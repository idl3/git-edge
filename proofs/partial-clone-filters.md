# Shallow and partial clone as first-class filters

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack` with `command=fetch` is parsed by the Worker (`protocol-v2-only`) into `{wants, haves, filter, deepen, shallow[]}` and sent as one RPC to the repo DO (`idFromName("owner/repo")`). The DO never touches R2: it plans the whole response from three SQLite tables the push parser fills at receive time -- `objects(sha,type,size)`, `commits(sha,tree,parents)` and a new `tree_entries(tree,child,kind)` edge table -- using recursive CTEs that apply `deepen N` as a depth cap on the commit walk and `blob:none` / `blob:limit=N` / `tree:N` as a `WHERE` clause on the tree walk, and returns `{shallow[], unshallow[], objs[{sha,type,size}]}`. The Worker then streams the v2 response (`shallow-info` section, then `packfile` section on side-band-64k) and, because it already knows every object's type and size, each object is exactly one `env.BUCKET.get(key, { range: { offset: looseHeaderLen } })` piped through `CompressionStream("deflate")` into a non-delta PACK. A later promisor fetch from the client (`want <blob-sha>` + `done`, which git sends for every missing blob on checkout/diff) goes through the same path with an empty walk, so it costs one SQLite lookup and one R2 range GET per blob.

## Primitives
- Durable Object with SQLite storage: `ctx.storage.sql.exec` with recursive CTEs and `json_each` over the object/commit/tree-edge tables -- GA
- DO RPC (`stub.plan(req)` typed method) -- GA
- R2 `get(key, { range: { offset } })` returning a `ReadableStream` body -- GA
- Workers streaming `Response` over `TransformStream`, `CompressionStream("deflate")` (zlib framing, which is what PACK entries require) -- GA
- Web Crypto has no incremental SHA-1, so the pack trailer uses a ~60-line pure-JS streaming SHA-1 (`Sha1` below) -- plain JS, nothing beta
- No beta primitives required.

## Why it works
- git protocol v2 says wants "can be anything and are not limited to advertised objects", which is exactly what the promisor machinery relies on: after a `blob:none` clone the client runs `git fetch --filter=blob:none --stdin` with bare blob oids, `fetch.negotiationAlgorithm=noop` and `done`. Our `plan` treats wanted blobs as terminal (no walk, filter not applied, per git's "explicitly wanted objects are always sent"), so the response is header + one entry + trailer, and the only I/O is one SQLite existence check and one R2 range GET.
- The capability line must be `fetch=shallow filter` (from `protocol-v2-only`'s advertisement) or the client refuses with "filtering not recognized by server"; nothing else is needed server-side because `uploadpack.allowFilter` is simply always on here.
- git-index-pack requires the object count in the 12-byte `PACK` header to be exact before it sees the first entry. Planning in SQLite (commit closure + `tree_entries` closure) yields the list, hence the count, before any R2 byte is read; a walk that discovered objects by reading trees from R2 would have to buffer or two-pass.
- Objects are stored as git's loose form `"<type> <size>\0" + content` (`content-addressed-r2-keys`), so type and size from the index give the header length and `range.offset` starts the R2 stream at byte 0 of the content; `CompressionStream("deflate")` emits a zlib stream, which is the framing every PACK entry uses. Non-delta packs (types 1-4 only) are always valid, so the client's `ofs-delta` capability is honoured by simply never emitting deltas.
- Shallow semantics follow upload-pack: `deepen N` caps the commit BFS at depth N-1, boundary commits that still have parents are reported as `shallow`, and any sha the client listed in its `shallow` lines that is now inside the set with parents is reported as `unshallow`; commit objects are sent unmodified because the client's `.git/shallow` file, not the object, records the cut.
- `tree:0` sends commits only; the client's follow-up `want <root-tree>` (again with `--filter=blob:none`) seeds the tree CTE from the wanted tree, so it receives that tree closure minus blobs in one round trip, matching what git's own upload-pack produces for the same request.

## Known limits
- Workers allow 1,000 subrequests per invocation and every `env.BUCKET.get` counts, so one fetch can carry at most ~1,000 objects on this path. That covers every lazy promisor batch git normally makes and the incremental fetches, but NOT a first `blob:none` clone of a repo with >1,000 commits+trees; that case must be served from a prebuilt blobless pack slice (`precomputed-clone-pack`, R2 range stream, 1 subrequest) or by fanning wants out in chunks of ~500 to a self service-binding that returns raw pack entries the outer Worker stitches and hashes. The fan-out is hand-waved above.
- Sequential `get` + deflate is ~10-30 ms per object; 1,000 small objects is 10-30 s of wall time (not CPU: deflate of trees/commits is tiny, so the 30 s CPU limit is not the constraint, but a prefetch window of ~16 in-flight GETs is needed for acceptable latency).
- `tree_entries` is one row per unique (tree, child) pair; for a very large monorepo that is millions of rows in DO SQLite (10 GB cap, fine) and the recursive CTE over the full closure can take seconds of DO CPU. The `objs` array returned by RPC must be paged (e.g. materialised into a temp table and read in 10k-row pages) for repos beyond ~100k objects; the proof returns it in one array.
- `haves` are ignored in the proof; subtracting the closure of haves is `want-have-negotiation`'s CTE and composes with the same depth/filter clauses.
- Not implemented: `deepen-since`, `deepen-not`, `deepen-relative`, `combine:` filters, `sparse:oid`, annotated-tag peeling of wants, and `blob:limit` with `k`/`m` suffixes (parse to bytes in the Worker).
- Each lazy blob is a Class B R2 operation (~$0.36 per million); a `git checkout` on a blobless clone of a 50k-file tree is 50k GETs, i.e. cents, but `git log -p` style workloads that touch every historical blob multiply that. `in-do-object-cache` can absorb the hot lockfile/config blobs.
- Web Crypto cannot hash incrementally; the pure-JS `Sha1` class is assumed, not shown.
