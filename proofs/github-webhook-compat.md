# GitHub-compatible webhook payloads

## Mechanism
A `POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` lands on the Worker, which forwards it to the repo DO (`idFromName("owner/repo")`); after the packfile is indexed and phase two of the push flips refs, the same `transactionSync` that writes the new ref values inserts one row per ref update into a `webhook_outbox` table in DO SQLite, then calls `ctx.storage.setAlarm(Date.now())`. The alarm handler drains the outbox: it builds a byte-for-byte GitHub `push` event JSON (`ref`, `before`, `after`, `created/deleted/forced`, `commits[]`, `head_commit`, `pusher`, `repository`), signs it with the hook secret as `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hmac>` via WebCrypto, and `fetch()`es each subscribed URL with `X-GitHub-Event`, `X-GitHub-Delivery` and a `GitHub-Hookshot/` user agent. Commit metadata comes from parsing the commit objects that the push just wrote (in-memory during indexing, or one R2 GET each on retry); failures are retried with exponential backoff by re-arming the alarm, so delivery is at-least-once and survives DO eviction because the outbox row is the source of truth.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `ctx.storage.transactionSync`) - GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `alarm()`) - GA
- R2 `env.BUCKET.get(key)` for commit objects not still in memory - GA
- WebCrypto `crypto.subtle.sign("HMAC")` for `X-Hub-Signature-256` - GA
- Outbound `fetch()` from the DO to the subscriber URL - GA
- `crypto.randomUUID()` for `X-GitHub-Delivery` - GA
- (optional) Queues for fan-out to many subscribers - GA, but not required here

## Proof code

// alarm drains it into GitHub-shaped `push` deliveries.

  // Called by the receive-pack path after objects are in R2 (two-phase-push, phase 2).

## Why it works
- Every field a receiver actually dispatches on (`ref`, `before`, `after`, `created`, `deleted`, `head_commit.id`, `repository.full_name`, `pusher.name`, `X-GitHub-Event`, `X-Hub-Signature-256`) is derivable from the receive-pack command lines (`<old-sha> <new-sha> <refname>` in pkt-line) plus the commit objects the push just delivered, so no extra git state is needed beyond what the push already contains.
- The outbox row is written in the same `transactionSync` as the ref flip, so a webhook is emitted iff the ref actually moved: no ghost events on rejected pushes, no lost events if the DO is evicted between flip and delivery.
- `X-Hub-Signature-256` is `HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw body)` hex-encoded; existing verifiers (`@octokit/webhooks`, Jenkins GitHub plugin, Argo CD) recompute it over the exact bytes, and we sign the same bytes we send.
- Delivery runs in `alarm()`, not in the push request, so the client's `git push` gets its `unpack ok` / `ok refs/heads/main` report-status pkt-lines immediately and a slow subscriber cannot stall the push or eat its CPU budget.
- Retries are idempotent from the receiver's point of view because `X-GitHub-Delivery` is stable across attempts (same row), matching GitHub's redelivery semantics.
- Commit parsing is the plain `tree`/`parent`/`author`/`committer` header lines of the loose commit object (`commit <len>\0` after inflate), which the pack indexer already has to inflate to do connectivity checks.

## Known limits
- `added/removed/modified` per commit require a tree diff against each parent; that is one R2 GET per changed tree object and is left empty here. Path-filtered CI (`paths:` in Actions workflows) would see nothing changed. Filling them means walking trees from R2 in the alarm, bounded to the 20-commit cap.
- `forced` is hard-coded `false`; computing it correctly needs to know whether `before` is an ancestor of `after`, which is a commit-graph query (want-have-negotiation's SQLite graph) rather than something the pushed pack alone tells you.
- The `commits` map only covers objects in this push; a push that references history not in the pack (already on the server) falls back to R2 GETs, costing one Class B request per commit and up to 20 per event.
- Only the `push` event is proven. `create`/`delete` are trivial siblings of the same row; `pull_request`, `issues`, `check_run` etc. have no source of truth in a bare git server unless reviews-as-refs or similar supplies it.
- The outbox drain is single-DO: a repo with N hooks fans out N HTTP calls per ref per push serially inside one alarm, each with a 10 s timeout, inside the alarm's CPU/wall budget. Past a handful of hooks, hand the row to Queues (commit-event-stream) instead of `fetch`ing from the DO.
- `repository.id`, `sender.id`, `installation` and the numeric `hook_id` GitHub Apps expect are synthetic; tooling that calls back to `api.github.com` with them will not work.
- Alarm scheduling is best-effort with retries capped at 5 attempts / ~15 min, versus GitHub's redelivery UI; there is no operator-facing redelivery button unless one is built on the outbox table.

## Depends on
- two-phase-push
- repo-do-ref-authority
- refs-sqlite-objects-r2
- streaming-pack-parser
- alarm-chain-ci (same alarm-as-queue pattern)
- commit-event-stream (for high fan-out)
