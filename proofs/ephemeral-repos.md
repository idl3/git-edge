# Ephemeral repos with a self-destruct alarm

## Mechanism

`POST /:owner/:repo?ttl=3600` (or the first `git push` carrying a scoped token with a TTL claim) hits the edge Worker, which does `env.REPO.idFromName("owner/repo")` and forwards to the per-repo `RepoDO`. The DO writes a `meta` row (`{epoch, expires_at}`) into its SQLite, arms `ctx.storage.setAlarm(expires_at)`, and from then on every object this repo stores goes to R2 under `repos/<owner>/<repo>/<epoch>/objects/<sha>` (loose or packed) while refs live in the DO's `refs` table. When the alarm fires, the DO first flips `meta.state = 'expired'` (so any concurrent `git-receive-pack` fails its ref CAS with `ng ... repo expired`), then pages through `env.BUCKET.list({prefix})` deleting up to 1000 keys per `env.BUCKET.delete(keys)` call, re-arming the alarm at `Date.now()` if the listing was truncated, and finally calls `ctx.storage.deleteAll()` + `deleteAlarm()` so the DO's SQLite is empty and its billing stops. A later `GET /info/refs` on the same name finds no `meta` row and returns 404 (git prints "repository not found"); a later `POST ?ttl=` creates a fresh epoch, so keys never collide with a deletion still in flight.

## Primitives

- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm` / `getAlarm` / `deleteAlarm`, at-least-once with automatic retry) — GA
- `ctx.storage.deleteAll()` (SQLite-backed DO: drops all tables and KV; note it does *not* clear the alarm) — GA
- R2 `list({prefix, cursor})` (1000 keys/page, Class A op) and bulk `delete(string[])` (max 1000 keys/call, free op) — GA
- Workers routing via `DurableObjectNamespace.idFromName` — GA
- Optional: DO `ctx.abort()`/`ctx.storage.deleteAll()` is the only "delete DO" primitive; there is no API to delete a DO *id*, only its storage — this is a GA limitation, not beta

```

## Why it works

- git's notion of "does this repo exist" is entirely `GET /info/refs?service=...`: a 404 there makes the client print `repository 'X' not found`, so an expired repo needs no tombstone beyond the missing `meta` row (and the DO id can never be deleted anyway — only its storage, which is exactly what `deleteAll()` does).
- A push is only "accepted" when `git-receive-pack` returns `unpack ok` followed by `ok <ref>` in report-status; returning `ng <ref> repo expired` for a push that was in flight during the alarm gives the client the normal `! [remote rejected]` and leaves its local state intact. Because the liveness check and the ref CAS run in the same synchronous SQL section (no `await` between them, so the DO input gate is closed), there is no window where a ref lands after expiry.
- Objects are immutable and only reachable through refs; once the `refs` table is wiped nothing can advertise them, so R2 deletion order does not matter for correctness — a clone that started before expiry may hit `early EOF` when a pack key vanishes mid-stream, which is the same failure git shows for any interrupted transport.
- The per-life `epoch` in the R2 prefix means a re-created `owner/repo` never shares keys with a deletion still paging through `list()`, and the pending alarm chain of the old life cannot delete the new life's objects.
- DO alarms are delivered at least once and retried with backoff on exceptions; the handler persists its `list()` cursor in SQLite, so an R2 hiccup or a large repo (>1000 keys) resumes from where it left off, and each alarm tick is one `list` + one `delete` — far inside the 30 s CPU budget.
- `expires-at=` is advertised as a capability token on the first ref line; stock git ignores unknown capabilities, while an aware client (or the `agent-native-commands` layer) can display the countdown.

## Known limits

- The idea says "deletes its DO state": there is no API to delete a Durable Object identity, only `ctx.storage.deleteAll()`; the DO named `owner/repo` still exists as an id and can be woken by a request (it just has empty storage and returns 404). This is the closest thing that exists and it is what Cloudflare recommends.
- Incompatible with `global-dedup` and with any `content-addressed-r2-keys` layout that shares keys across repos: self-destruct requires that the R2 prefix be exclusively owned by this repo life (`repos/<owner>/<repo>/<epoch>/`). Sharing objects would need refcounts in D1 or a mark phase — hand-waved here.
- `list()` costs one Class A op per 1000 keys ($4.50/M) even though `delete` is free; a loose-object layout with 100k objects means ~100 alarm ticks. Packing on push (`precomputed-clone-pack`) keeps key counts tiny.
- The alarm fires with at-least-once semantics and may run a few seconds late under load; the TTL is "at least one hour", not "exactly one hour". Alarms are also delivered only when the DO is not overloaded; a repo receiving a firehose of pushes at expiry could delay its own death slightly.
- Receive-pack here buffers the pack body into a single `BUCKET.put` for brevity. Real pushes need `streaming-pack-parser` (indexing, ofs-delta resolution) and stay under the DO 128 MB memory limit only if the pack is streamed to R2 (multipart) rather than materialized.
- Single-DO throughput: all pushes and the alarm serialize on one object, which is intended (ref authority), but means a very large deletion chain competes with reads of a re-created repo of the same name.
- Sliding TTL (`touch` on every push) is trivial — update `expires_at` and `setAlarm` — but not shown; the handler already tolerates an alarm that fires before the extended deadline.
