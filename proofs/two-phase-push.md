# Two-phase push

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` lands on the Worker, which first calls `repoDO.begin()` so the repo DO records an open push id in SQLite (and arms the janitor alarm) before a single byte hits R2. The Worker then streams the request body: it reads the pkt-line command section (`<old> <new> <refname>\0report-status ...`), then inflates the `PACK` stream object by object, writing each loose object to R2 at `objects/<sha>` (content-addressed, idempotent) and accumulating a manifest of every sha plus the links it extracted (commit→tree/parents, tree→entries), which it writes to `pending/<pushId>/manifest.json`. Phase two is `repoDO.commit(pushId)`: the DO reads the manifest, checks each ref's old value against its `refs` table (compare-and-swap), checks connectivity using only the manifest links and its own `objects` index (no R2 reads), and in one SQLite transaction inserts the new object rows, moves the refs and closes the push; the Worker turns the result into `report-status` pkt-lines. A crash between the phases leaves an open push row; the alarm sweeps rows older than the push timeout and deletes their R2 keys unless the sha is already committed or claimed by another still-open push.

## Primitives
- Workers (request body streaming, `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib object bodies, `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")`)
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `ctx.storage.transactionSync`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `alarm()`) — GA
- DO RPC (`WorkerEntrypoint`/`DurableObject` extends from `cloudflare:workers`, typed stub methods) — GA
- R2 (`put`, `get`, `delete` of up to 1000 keys per call) — GA
- Nothing beta is required.

## Why it works
- `git-receive-pack` semantics are exactly "here is a pack, here are ref commands, tell me per ref": the wire format needs only `unpack ok` and `ok/ng <ref>` pkt-lines after the pack is consumed, and nothing requires the server to have finished storing before it starts reading, so R2 writes can happen while the body streams.
- Git's own guarantee on push is per-ref compare-and-swap of `<old>` (what the client last fetched) against the current tip; the DO is single-threaded per repo, so `SELECT sha FROM refs` followed by the write inside `transactionSync` is a true CAS with no distributed lock. Concurrent pushes to the same ref serialize; the loser gets `ng <ref> fetch first`, which is what git prints today.
- Connectivity is the check upstream `receive-pack` does with `rev-list --objects --not --all`: every object reachable from the new tip must exist. Because the Worker already inflated every object to hash it, extracting `tree`/`parent` lines and tree entries is free, so the DO validates from the manifest plus its `objects` index and never reads object bytes from R2.
- Objects are immutable and content-addressed, so a retried push (client re-sends the same pack after a 5xx) rewrites identical bytes to identical keys; nothing about phase one is observable until phase two flips the refs, which is why the pending manifest, not the object keys, is the unit of "in flight".
- The order `begin()` → R2 writes → `commit()` means the DO always knows about a push before any orphan can exist, so the janitor never needs to list the bucket; it reads only manifests it created and skips any sha claimed by a still-open push, which closes the race where two pushes share a blob and one is swept.
- The alarm is re-armed only while `pending` is non-empty, so an idle repo costs nothing; a DO with an alarm set survives eviction and the sweep runs even if no client ever returns.

## Known limits
- "Pending prefix for objects" is not literally what is written: R2 has no rename, so writing objects under `pending/<id>/objects/*` and moving them on commit would double every write. The proof keeps objects at their final content-addressed key and puts only the manifest under `pending/`; orphans are therefore committed-looking keys that the `objects` index does not know about. Reads must consult the index (or a reachable ref) and never trust key presence alone.
- One R2 class-A PUT per object: a 50k-object push is 50k PUTs (roughly $0.23 at $4.50/M) and tens of seconds of wall time even with concurrency; batching small objects into a pack-per-push in R2 (one multipart upload, then range reads) is the real fix and is a sibling idea, not this one.
- The Worker must inflate every object to compute its SHA-1 and to extract links; a delta-heavy pack needs base objects, which means R2 GETs during parse (`streaming-pack-parser`). CPU is capped at 30s by default (configurable up to 5 min on paid plans); a monorepo initial push will exceed it unless split (`presigned-direct-upload`).
- The manifest is a single JSON object; at ~60 bytes per entry a million-object push is a 60MB manifest that the DO must parse in its 128MB heap. Chunking the manifest is straightforward but not shown.
- Connectivity is validated from manifest-declared links, not by re-reading the objects, so it trusts the Worker that produced the manifest. That is acceptable because the Worker is first-party code, but a corrupted object body with a correct sha would not be caught here (git's own `fsck` is equally optional on receive).
- The `objects` table grows one row per object in SQLite; DO storage is 10GB per object, fine for refs and a sha index but the `SELECT 1 ... WHERE sha = ?` per link is a few microseconds each, so a million-link commit spends about a second of DO CPU inside one transaction, during which the repo takes no other request.
- Per-ref success with a partial failure (default git behaviour) means a crashed Worker after `commit()` returned but before `report-status` reached the client leaves refs advanced while the client sees an error; that matches how git over HTTP already behaves and the client's next fetch reconciles it.
- Sweep timeout is a fixed 15 minutes; a legitimately slow push that runs longer is rejected at `commit()` with "push expired" rather than risking a sweep under its feet. `atomic` push-option (all-or-nothing across refs) is one line, shown as a comment, not wired.
