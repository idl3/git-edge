# Speculative packs

## Mechanism
Every protocol-v2 `fetch` that the repo DO answers is logged as `(client_key, ref, delivered_tip)` in DO SQLite; the prediction is trivial and git-exact: a client that was just handed tip `A` for `refs/heads/main` will, on its next fetch of that ref, send `want <new tip>` and `have A`. So when `git-receive-pack` moves `main` from `A` to `B`, the DO sets an alarm ~100 ms out; the alarm handler takes the distinct `delivered_tip`s of recent fetchers of that ref, and for each one builds the incremental pack `A..B` once (commit-graph walk in SQLite, one R2 range read per object from the pack index) and stores it under `spec/<A>..<B>.pack` in R2, mirrored into SQLite BLOB chunks when it is small. The next `POST /<owner>/<repo>/git-upload-pack` whose wants/haves match `(B, A)` is answered straight from the cache as `acknowledgments` + `ready` + sideband `packfile`, with zero object-level R2 reads and no delta work on the request path.

## Primitives
- Durable Object with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) - GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `alarm()`) - GA
- R2 `put` / `get` with `range: {offset, length}` - GA; R2 lifecycle rule to expire the `spec/` prefix after 7 days - GA
- `crypto.DigestStream("SHA-1")` for the streaming pack trailer - Cloudflare-specific (non-standard WebCrypto extension, but GA on Workers)
- `TransformStream` / `ReadableStream` piping for the sideband-64k framing - GA
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` is only needed on the miss path (idea #4), not here

## Why it works
- git's own negotiation is the predictor. After a successful fetch the client updates `refs/remotes/origin/main` to the delivered tip, and the next `fetch` sends that tip as its first `have` (it is the ref-tip, so it is always in the first 32-have batch). The prediction is not a heuristic about behaviour, it is the protocol's state machine run one step ahead.
- Correctness does not depend on the prediction being exact. A cached pack `A..B` is a valid answer for any client whose haves *include* `A`, even if it also sends haves the server does not know (local-only branches) or knows but did not use: extra objects in a pack are harmless to `index-pack`, and the pack's thin deltas are only against objects reachable from `A`, which that client provably has. The DO only ACKs `A`, which is exactly what the v2 spec allows ("ACK for each have the server has").
- The v2 `fetch` response is one-shot when the server can say `ready`: `acknowledgments` (`ACK <oid>`, `ready`), delim `0001`, then `packfile` in sideband-64k band 1 with a `0000` flush. That shape is fixed by the protocol, so a pre-built pack can be wrapped at serve time without re-parsing it.
- Pack bytes are cacheable because the set `reachable(B) - reachable(A)` and the PACK v2 encoding (12-byte `PACK\0\0\0\2<count>` header, entries, 20-byte SHA-1 trailer) are deterministic for a given `(A, B)`; nothing about the response is per-client.
- Packs compose: if `main` moved `A -> B -> C` and only `A..B` and `B..C` are cached, `A..C` is their concatenated entry lists with a patched count and re-hashed trailer, since ofs-delta offsets are backward-relative and ref-deltas resolve by SHA. So the alarm never has to rebuild from scratch for stale fetchers; only the trailer needs recomputing (streamable with `DigestStream`).
- The alarm makes the push path free: `receive-pack` only inserts a row and arms one alarm; the 100 ms `setAlarm` coalesces a burst of pushes into one prewarm pass, and the DO serialises it with the next fetch so a hit is either fully built or a plain miss.

## Known limits
- The only fetchers this helps are single-ref trackers: CI runners, mirrors, deploy agents, and agent-harness DOs (grok-pi sessions). A developer with many local branches sends dozens of haves and different wants; the lookup still hits on the tracked tip, but the cached pack may be larger than the minimal one git would compute (it only subtracts `A`, not the developer's other branches).
- Pack bytes cross the DO heap once when built (`arrayBuffer` in `speculate`), so the 32 MB `SPEC_MAX` cap exists to stay well under the DO's 128 MB memory; big ref moves (a merge that touches 100 MB of new blobs) are simply not speculated and fall back to the miss path.
- SQLite chunks are capped at 4 MB per pack by choice (row values are limited to 2 MB, hence the 1 MB chunking) and total DO storage at 10 GB; the R2 copy is the real cache, so a hit that misses the inline chunks still costs exactly one Class B R2 op plus egress-free streaming.
- Prewarm cost is N R2 range reads per predicted pack (one per object) times up to 8 predicted haves per ref move; on a very active branch with many distinct stale fetchers that is real R2 request spend, so the `LIMIT 8` and 7-day window are load-bearing, not cosmetic.
- The alarm runs on the same single DO as fetch/push, so a long prewarm delays the next request on that repo; alarm handlers have the same 30 s CPU budget by default (raise `limits.cpu_ms`), and building 8 packs of 32 MB each can exceed it. In practice the alarm should build one pack per invocation and re-arm itself.
- Pack composition (`A..B ++ B..C`) is asserted, not shown in the proof code; the header count patch is trivial but the trailer re-hash forces a full pass over both packs.
- The `pkt("")` placeholder / `IdentityTransform` / `concat` helpers in the sideband writer are hand-waved; the framing itself (4-byte hex length, band byte `\x01`, 65515-byte payload max) is what matters.
- `buildPack` is a stub; it is ideas #56 and #4 and is what the miss path already needs.

## Depends on
- `want-have-negotiation` (#56) for the commit-graph walk that decides `reachable(B) - reachable(A)`
- `streaming-pack-parser` (#4) for the SQLite pack index that turns an OID into an R2 `(key, offset, length)` range
- `refs-sqlite-objects-r2` (#2), `repo-do-ref-authority` (#1), `protocol-v2-only` (#3)
- `two-phase-push` (#6) for the `refMoved` hook after the ref CAS
- composes with `pinned-delta-bases` (#8) and `in-do-object-cache` (#9), which cover the miss path this idea sidesteps
