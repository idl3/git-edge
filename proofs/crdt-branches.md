# Multi-writer CRDT branches

## Mechanism
A branch under `refs/heads/live/*` is not a sha in the `refs` table; it is an op log in DO SQLite (`crdt_ops(branch, actor, lamport, path, blob_sha|NULL)`) whose merged state is a path -> blob map (a per-path last-writer-wins register ordered by `(lamport, actor)`, plus per-path diff3 against the common base when two actors touched the same file). Writers reach the `RepoDO` two ways: agents `POST /:owner/:repo/live/:branch/ops` with JSON ops after putting blobs content-addressed into R2, and plain git clients `git push` a commit to `refs/heads/live/foo`; `git-receive-pack` never rejects a non-fast-forward there, it diffs the pushed commit's tree against the tip it was based on and appends those path edits as ops. The DO debounces with `ctx.storage.setAlarm(now+1500)`; the alarm materializes the merged map into real git `tree` objects, then an n-parent merge `commit` whose parents are every contributing commit since the last materialization, `env.BUCKET.put`s them under `objects/<sha>`, and flips `refs/heads/live/foo` in SQLite. The push reply uses `report-status-v2` with `option new-oid <materialized>` so the client's remote-tracking ref lands on the real tip and its next `git pull` is a fast-forward.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) -- GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) for debounced materialization and op-log compaction -- GA
- R2 (`env.BUCKET.put/get`, content-addressed keys) for blobs, trees, commits -- GA
- `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` for git object ids -- GA
- `CompressionStream("deflate")` (zlib) when a materialized object must be served in a pack -- GA
- No beta primitives required

## Proof code
```typescript
// One RepoDO per repo (repo-do-ref-authority). Blobs/trees/commits live in R2 under objects/<sha>

## Why it works
- git does not care how a commit came to exist, only that `tree`/`commit` bytes hash to the sha the ref advertises; `putObject` produces byte-exact loose-object content (`"<type> <len>\0"` + payload, tree entries `mode SP name NUL sha20` in git's sort order), so `git fsck` on a clone of `refs/heads/live/foo` passes.
- `git-receive-pack` only requires `unpack ok` and one `ok <ref>` status line per command; with `report-status-v2` (git >= 2.29, the proc-receive hook protocol) the server may add `option new-oid <sha>` / `option forced-update`, and the client then sets `refs/remotes/origin/live/foo` to the materialized merge rather than to what it pushed. This is exactly the mechanism GitHub-style "push rewritten by server" hooks use.
- Because every contributing pushed commit becomes a parent of the materialized merge, each writer's next `git pull` is a fast-forward (their commit is an ancestor of the tip), so classic clients never see a rejected push or a forced divergence on a live branch.
- The CRDT is a per-path LWW register with `(lamport, actor)` total order plus an idempotent op log keyed by `(branch, actor, lamport, path)`: replaying a retried push or agent POST is a no-op, and the DO's single-threaded event loop is the serialization point, so merge order is deterministic without vector clocks across regions.
- Blobs never touch the DO; agents put them into R2 by sha before posting ops, git pushes have them indexed by `streaming-pack-parser`, and materialization only writes small tree/commit objects, so per-materialization R2 writes are O(changed directories + 1).
- `refs/heads/live/*` is served by `ls-refs`/`fetch` exactly like any ref once materialized; non-live refs keep classic compare-and-swap, so the wild behaviour is opt-in per namespace.

## Known limits
- "CRDT" is true at path granularity only: concurrent edits to the same file are reconciled by diff3 when a common base blob is known, and a real diff3 conflict falls back to LWW (the loser's version is preserved only as a parent commit, not in the tree). A line-level text CRDT would need every writer to send character ops, which `git push` cannot express; this is the honest shape of the idea.
- Materialization runs inside the DO: tree building is O(files) SQLite rows and one R2 PUT per changed directory, and diff3 reads two or three blobs from R2 per conflicting path. A 100k-file branch with many touched dirs will approach the 30s wall-clock budget of a single alarm/request; split by dirty-directory pages across alarms (not shown).
- `Date.now()` as a Lamport clock is a hand-wave; correct behaviour needs `lamport = max(seen)+1` per actor, stored in a small `clocks` table, or ties between two actors in the same millisecond resolve by actor id string order.
- Every push to a live branch creates a new merge commit, so history is noisy (one commit per debounce window per branch); DO memory (128MB) is not the constraint, R2 PUT cost per materialization and commit-graph growth are.
- One DO per repo means all live branches of a repo serialize through one event loop; a busy repo should shard live branches into branch DOs (`branch-level-dos`).
- Old clients (git < 2.29, no `report-status-v2`) get plain `ok <ref>` and their remote-tracking ref points at their own pushed commit until the next fetch; harmless but confusing.
- `treeDiff`, `diff3Blob`, `parseCommandPktLines`, `pktLines`, `gitTreeOrder` and `concat` are pseudo; tree walking against R2 is one GET per tree object unless `in-do-object-cache` fronts it.
