# Push-triggered CI as a DO alarm chain

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` is handled by the repo DO (`repo-do-ref-authority`); after it has flipped the refs and *before* it writes the `report-status` pkt-lines back to the client, it calls `env.CI_RUN.get(idFromName("owner/repo@newSha")).start(...)` over DO RPC. The CiRun DO inserts one row per stage into its own SQLite table `stages` and calls `ctx.storage.setAlarm(Date.now())`; nothing else is enqueued anywhere. Each `alarm()` invocation claims the next `pending` stage, runs it (reading the commit's tree blobs from R2 by SHA), records the result in SQLite, and re-arms the alarm for the next stage; the terminal alarm writes a status blob to R2 and asks the repo DO to point `refs/ci/<sha>` at it so `git ls-remote` / `git fetch` can read the verdict with no extra API.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm` / `alarm()` / `deleteAlarm`) — GA; at-least-once, one alarm per DO
- DO RPC (`extends DurableObject`, calling methods on a stub) — GA
- R2 (`env.BUCKET.get/put`, content-addressed keys) — GA
- Service bindings / Workers for Platforms dynamic dispatch for user-supplied stage code — service bindings GA; Workers for Platforms is a paid add-on (dispatch namespaces)
- `limits.cpu_ms` in wrangler to lift the 30 s CPU cap per alarm to 300 s — GA on Paid

## Proof code
```typescript
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

type Env = { BUCKET: R2Bucket; REPO: DurableObjectNamespace; CI_RUN: DurableObjectNamespace<CiRun>; STAGE_WORKER: Fetcher };
type Stage = { seq: number; name: string; status: "pending" | "running" | "ok" | "fail"; attempts: number; log: string | null };
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3, WATCHDOG_MS = 90_000;

export class CiRun extends DurableObject<Env> {
  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);
    ctx.storage.sql.exec(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS run    (k TEXT PRIMARY KEY, v TEXT NOT NULL);
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stages (seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL,
        status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, log TEXT)`);
  }

  // Called by the repo DO over RPC right after the ref flip, before report-status is sent.
  async start(p: { repo: string; ref: string; sha: string; stages: string[] }): Promise<void> {
    if (this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("SELECT 1 FROM stages LIMIT 1").toArray().length) return; // idempotent: same sha => same DO id
    this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("INSERT INTO run VALUES ('repo',?),('ref',?),('sha',?)", p.repo, p.ref, p.sha);
    p.stages.forEach((name, i) => this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("INSERT INTO stages (seq,name) VALUES (?,?)", i, name));
    await this.ctx.storage.setAlarm(Date.now()); // first stage runs on the next alarm tick, push returns immediately
  }

  async alarm(): Promise<void> {
    const sql = this.ctx.storage.sql;
    const cur = sql.exec<Stage>("SELECT * FROM stages WHERE status IN ('pending','running') ORDER BY seq LIMIT 1").toArray()[0];

## Why it works
- `git push` only cares that `report-status` arrives after the refs are durable: `unpack ok` then `ok refs/heads/main` (or `ng refs/heads/main <reason>`) in pkt-lines, then flush. Scheduling the alarm is a single SQLite write plus `setAlarm`, both in the same DO transaction as the ref flip, so the push returns in the same round-trip and CI can never be lost between "ref moved" and "job enqueued".
- One CiRun DO per `owner/repo@sha` gives free idempotency: a re-push of the same commit or a retried HTTP request lands on the same DO id and `start()` sees the existing rows. This mirrors git's own content-addressing.
- DO alarms are at-least-once with automatic retry on throw. The code relies on that only as a backstop: the `running` state plus the watchdog alarm make a crashed isolate resume at the right stage, and `attempts` bounds retries so a deterministic failure does not loop forever.
- The chain is strictly ordered because a DO has exactly one alarm and `alarm()` invocations on the same DO never overlap; that is the "no queue service" claim made honest, and it is the same guarantee git users expect from hooks (`pre-receive` then `update` then `post-receive`, serially).
- Stages read the pushed commit's tree straight from R2 by SHA, the same objects `git-receive-pack` just indexed (`streaming-pack-parser`), so CI never re-fetches or checks out.
- The verdict is a real blob object under `refs/ci/<sha>`, so `git ls-remote origin 'refs/ci/*'` and `git fetch origin refs/ci/<sha>` show and retrieve CI status using protocol v2 `ls-refs ref-prefix` with no side API; it also survives a DO wipe because it is just objects plus a ref.

## Known limits
- Not real CI as most people mean it: no Linux, no shell, no `npm test`. A "stage" is a Worker (JS/Wasm) reached via service binding or a Workers-for-Platforms dispatch namespace, or a built-in check (lint, schema validation, size limits, calling an external runner). Running arbitrary user scripts requires `hooks-as-workers` or Workers for Platforms; `new Function`/`eval` are blocked in Workers.
- Per-alarm CPU budget is 30 s by default (up to 300 s with `limits.cpu_ms` on Paid). Wall-clock waits on R2 or subrequests do not count, but a stage that needs more CPU must be split across alarm ticks by the stage author.
- One alarm per DO means one running stage per run; parallel matrix jobs need one CiRun DO per job (`idFromName(sha + "/" + job)`) plus a small fan-in row in a parent DO. Each DO is single-threaded, so throughput per run is bounded, not per repo.
- Alarm scheduling is best-effort on timing (typically fires within seconds, can lag under load); the watchdog lease trades duplicate execution for liveness, so stages must be idempotent (they are, if they only write content-addressed objects).
- DO memory is 128 MB; a stage that inflates a big tree into memory must stream (`DecompressionStream`) and not hold whole packs. Large trees also cost one R2 GET per blob (Class B ops), and the 1000-subrequest limit per invocation caps how many blobs one alarm tick can read.
- The proof hand-waves the git object encoding helpers (`gitBlobSha`, zlib header) and the repo DO's `set-ref` CAS endpoint; both are foundation work owned by other slugs.
