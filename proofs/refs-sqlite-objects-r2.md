# Refs in DO SQLite, objects in R2

## Mechanism
`GET /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` and `POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` land on the Worker, which routes to `env.REPO.idFromName("owner/repo")` — one `RepoDO` per repo. The DO keeps a `refs(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, sha TEXT)` table plus a small `objects(sha, type, size)` index in `ctx.storage.sql`; every ref read/advertise/compare-and-swap is a local SQLite statement. Object bodies never live in the DO: a push streams its packfile through the Worker, each inflated object is `PUT` to R2 at `objects/<owner>/<repo>/<sha>` (immutable, idempotent), and only after all `put`s resolve does the DO run the ref update inside one `transactionSync`. A fetch reads the wanted SHAs from SQLite, then `env.BUCKET.get(key)` per object (or a range read into a precomputed pack) to build the response pack.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) for sweeping orphaned pending objects — GA
- R2 (`env.BUCKET.put/get/head/list`, `get(key, { range })`) — GA
- Workers streams (`Request.body` ReadableStream, `Response` from a `ReadableStream`) — GA
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib-wrapped git objects (each git object stream is zlib with the 2-byte header, which "deflate" mode accepts) — GA in workerd
- `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` for object ids — GA
- `nodejs_compat` (only if `zlib.inflateSync` is preferred for per-object inflate with an unknown compressed length) — GA

```

## Why it works
- A push in smart-HTTP v0 is exactly: pkt-line ref commands, `0000`, then a raw `PACK` stream; `git-receive-pack` expects back `unpack ok` plus one `ok`/`ng` line per ref (the `report-status` capability). The DO produces precisely that, and `ng ... fetch first` is what git itself emits on a non-fast-forward.
- Git's atomicity contract is per-ref compare-and-swap on `<old-sha> <new-sha>`; a single DO per repo plus `transactionSync` gives that trivially (idea 1), with no locks or conditional writes on R2.
- Objects are content-addressed and immutable, so `BUCKET.put(sha)` is idempotent: a retried push, a concurrent push of the same commit, or a crashed push re-run cannot corrupt anything; the worst outcome is an orphan the alarm sweeps.
- Ordering "all R2 puts resolved, then refs flip" is the same invariant loose-object git relies on (objects before refs), so a reader that sees a ref can always fetch its closure.
- The ref advertisement is a `SELECT` over a table of a few KB, so `info/refs` (the request every `git fetch`/`ls-remote` makes) never touches R2; R2 cost scales with objects transferred, not with polling.
- The DO keeps only an `objects(sha,type,size)` index (~60 B/row), so the closure walk for `upload-pack` is a SQLite query; a 100k-object repo is ~6 MB of SQLite, well inside the DO's 10 GB storage.

## Known limits
- Per-object R2 `put`/`get` costs one Class A/B op each; a push of 5,000 small objects is 5,000 puts (~$0.02) and a fresh clone is 5,000 gets plus latency of a few ms each serialized through one DO. Real clones need `precomputed-clone-pack` / `bundle-uri`; per-object R2 is fine for incremental fetch and push.
- The receive path resolves deltas in the Worker/DO. A single request has ~30 s CPU on paid Workers and the DO isolate has 128 MB; a pack with a multi-hundred-MB blob or deep delta chains must be chunked (`presigned-direct-upload`) or offloaded to Wasm (`wasm-git-core`). Hand-waved here as `parsePack`.
- The DO receives the request body as a stream, but the whole pack still flows through a single DO isolate; sustained throughput is bounded by one DO (~tens of MB/s, one push at a time). Acceptable for a repo; shard by `branch-level-dos` for monorepos.
- `transactionSync` cannot await, so R2 puts happen before the transaction and refs are validated only against the SQLite `objects` index, not by re-`head`ing R2. A lost R2 write (put resolved but object missing) is not detectable here; a periodic `list` reconciliation in the alarm would close that gap.
- The ref advertisement uses protocol v0 pkt-line for the proof; `protocol-v2-only` replaces `advertise` with `ls-refs` but the storage model is unchanged.
- `idFromName` does not return the name, so the Worker must pass `owner/repo` (shown as `x-repo-prefix` header); on first request after eviction it is re-derived, which is fine because the DO id is stable.
- SHA-1 only; SHA-256 repos would need a `hash_algo` column, trivially.

## Depends on
- repo-do-ref-authority
- content-addressed-r2-keys
- streaming-pack-parser (for `parsePack` on receive)
- info-refs-endpoint (pkt-line codec shown inline as `pkt`)
