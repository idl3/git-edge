# Speak git protocol v2 only, translate v0 at the edge

## Mechanism
The Worker is the only thing that ever sees pkt-lines: `GET /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` with header `Git-Protocol: version=2` gets a static v2 capability advertisement (`version 2`, `ls-refs`, `fetch=shallow wait-for-done`, `object-info`) without touching a DO; `POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack` is parsed into one v2 command (`command=ls-refs` / `command=fetch` / `command=object-info`, args, flush) and forwarded as a JSON RPC to the repo DO (`idFromName("owner/repo")`), which answers `ls-refs` straight from its `refs` SQLite table and answers `fetch` by resolving wants/haves to an object list. The Worker turns that answer back into pkt-lines: the `packfile` section is streamed as side-band-64k frames from R2 range reads, so nothing is buffered in DO memory. A client that omits `Git-Protocol` (v0/v1) hits the same handler behind a shim: the v0 ref advertisement is generated from the same `ls-refs` answer, and a v0 `want`/`have`/`done` body is rewritten into an internal `fetch` command, so there is exactly one code path for negotiation and pack streaming. Push has no v2 at all in git (receive-pack is always v0/v1, even with `protocol.version=2`), so `git-receive-pack` is a single stateless v0 POST (`<old> <new> <ref>\0caps` lines, flush, `PACK`) handled by the push pipeline, not by this shim.

## Primitives
- Workers (fetch handler, `ReadableStream`/`TransformStream` for pkt-line + side-band framing, `Git-Protocol` header sniffing)
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec` on the `refs` table for `ls-refs`) — GA
- DO RPC (`stub.lsRefs()` / `stub.negotiate()` typed methods instead of nested `fetch`) — GA
- R2 `get(key, { range })` for streaming the pack body — GA
- No beta primitives required. (`packfile-uris` in the v2 fetch response, used by `bundle-uri`, is a git-side feature, not a Cloudflare one.)

## Why it works
- git sends `Git-Protocol: version=2` as an HTTP header on the `info/refs` GET (and every POST) whenever `protocol.version` is 2, which has been the default since git 2.26; the header is the whole version-selection mechanism, so a Worker can branch on it before doing any work. A server that answers `version 2` in the advertisement commits the client to command mode for the rest of the session.
- Protocol v2 was designed to be stateless: every POST is a self-contained `command=...` block, and `fetch` re-sends all `have`s each round (with `stateless-rpc` semantics baked in). That is exactly the Workers request/response model; no DO needs to hold negotiation state between rounds, only the `refs` and `commit_graph` tables.
- `ls-refs` requires only `<oid> <refname>` pkt-lines plus optional `symref-target:`/`peeled:` attributes; that is a single `SELECT` on the repo DO, so the ref advertisement never scales with repo size beyond the number of refs, and `ref-prefix` args let the DO filter server-side.
- The v2 `fetch` response is sectioned (`acknowledgments`, `ready`, delim, `packfile`) and the pack is carried on side-band band 1 in frames of at most 65520 bytes, which maps 1:1 onto a `TransformStream` fed by an R2 range read; the Worker never sees the whole pack. Band 2 is free for progress text and band 3 for a fatal error, all without breaking the stream.
- The v0 shim is cheap because smart-HTTP v0 is already `stateless-rpc`: the client resends the full `want`/`have`/`done` conversation on each POST, so the only real difference is the wire format of the advertisement (caps hidden after `\0` on the first ref line, `HEAD` first) and the `NAK`/`ACK` line before the pack. Both are handled in a few lines, and `no-done` lets the server send the pack as soon as it has enough haves.
- receive-pack is unaffected: git never negotiates v2 for push, so a v0 `git-receive-pack` POST (commands, flush, `PACK` stream) is the only push path and is stateless anyway; the `report-status-v2` response format is emitted by the push pipeline.

## Known limits
- "v2 only" is not literally achievable: git has no v2 receive-pack, so push is v0/v1 forever. The honest statement is "v2 for all fetch-side traffic, v0 accepted on the wire for fetch (via shim) and required for push".
- Dumb HTTP clients (no `service=` query, or fetching `objects/info/packs`) are not covered by the shim above. They can be served by pointing `objects/info/packs` and `objects/pack/*` at the precomputed R2 pack, but only for a full clone, never for an incremental fetch; the proof hand-waves this.
- The v0 shim collapses multi-round negotiation into "answer with whatever `negotiate` returns"; a correct v0 server must emit `ACK <oid> continue`/`common` lines per round under `multi_ack_detailed`. Without that, v0 clients with a lot of local history may receive a larger pack than necessary (correct, but wasteful).
- Streaming the pack from R2 assumes an object list can be turned into an R2 key plus range (precomputed pack) or a thin pack assembled by another component; the proof does not build packs, it only frames them. Per-object packing for arbitrary want sets is idea 4/56/7 territory.
- Workers request limits: the pack stream is a Response body so it is not subject to the 128 MB Worker memory cap, but the 30 s CPU budget is only safe because framing is byte copying; any zlib work on the fetch path would need chunking across requests.
- `wait-for-done` and `packfile-uris` are advertised only when the corresponding ideas (`want-have-negotiation`, `bundle-uri`) are implemented; advertising a capability you do not honour makes git error out mid-fetch.
- R2 cost: every fetch is at least one Class B GET plus one DO request; `ls-refs` goes to the DO on every `git fetch`, so a hot repo with many pollers is bounded by single-DO throughput (roughly low thousands of req/s) until `replicated-refs-edge` moves reads to KV.
