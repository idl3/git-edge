# Server-side rebase and squash as protocol v2 extensions

## Mechanism
The Worker's `GET /:owner/:repo/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` (with `Git-Protocol: version=2`) advertises two extra capability lines, `rebase=squash` and `rebase-status`, next to the standard `ls-refs`/`fetch`/`object-info`; git's v2 spec makes clients ignore capability lines they do not understand, so stock `git` sees nothing new and only a git-edge-aware client sends `command=rebase` on `POST /git-upload-pack`. The Worker parses the pkt-line command section (`onto`, `branch`, `expect` for compare-and-swap, optional `squash`, `message`) and forwards it over RPC to the repo Durable Object (`idFromName("owner/repo")`), which serializes the operation with every push. The DO walks `merge-base..branch` from its SQLite commit-graph table, replays each commit as a three-way tree merge against the moving `onto` tip, writes each new commit/tree object as a zlib loose object to `R2 objects/<sha>` (idempotent, content-addressed), and finally CAS-flips `refs/heads/<branch>` in SQLite and appends a reflog row. Replays longer than one request budget checkpoint their cursor in a `rebase_jobs` row and continue from `alarm()`; the client polls `command=rebase-status` until it gets `ack <newtip>` or a `conflict` section, then does a normal `fetch` + `reset --hard`.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql`) — refs, commit-graph, `rebase_jobs` (GA)
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) — continuation of long replays (GA)
- DO RPC (Worker → DO method call via `env.REPO.get(id).rebase(...)`) (GA)
- R2 `put`/`get` for loose objects (GA)
- Web `CompressionStream("deflate")` / `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib loose objects (GA in workerd)
- `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` for object ids (GA)
- Optional: Wasm merge core for blob-level diff3 — see Depends on (not a Cloudflare primitive; Wasm modules on Workers are GA)

## Why it works
- Protocol v2 capability advertisement is an open list: `git` only acts on lines it knows (`ls-refs`, `fetch`, `object-info`, `server-option`, `agent`), so `rebase=squash` is silently ignored by every existing client. That is exactly what "unknown to old clients" means; a new command is not a new transport.
- `command=rebase` reuses the v2 request framing unchanged: capability lines, `0001` delim, argument lines, `0000` flush; the response uses the same pkt-line sectioning (`ack`, or `conflict` + delim + paths) that `fetch` uses for `acknowledgments`/`packfile`, so a client written against `pkt-line` needs no new codec.
- A rebase is `git cherry-pick` in a loop: for each commit C, three-way merge `parent(C)` (base), current head (ours), `C` (theirs) and commit the result on head. At tree granularity this is a pure function over immutable objects already in R2, so the DO never needs a working directory or index.
- New commits and trees are ordinary loose objects (`<type> <len>\0` header, zlib) under content-addressed keys, so a subsequent `fetch` by any client, old or new, serves them like anything pushed by `git-receive-pack`; nothing about the rewritten history is server-specific.
- The single repo DO is the ref authority, so the CAS `UPDATE refs ... WHERE oid=expect` gives the same non-fast-forward protection `git push` relies on, even when the replay spans several alarm steps interleaved with pushes.
- Squash is the degenerate case: one merge of the branch tip against `onto`, one commit; no per-commit replay, no alarm chain.

## Known limits
- Stock `git` cannot invoke this. The capability is advertised, but only a git-edge client (a `git edge rebase` helper speaking pkt-line over HTTP) sends `command=rebase`. The only stock-client bridge is a push-option (`git push -o rebase=main`), which is idea #17's channel, not a v2 command.
- Blob-level conflict resolution is hand-waved. Tree-level merge (add/delete/rename-less) is easy in TypeScript; same-file edits need diff3, which realistically means the Wasm git core. Without it, same-path edits are reported as conflicts, which is correct but conservative.
- Every tree object touched is an R2 GET (~µs of CPU but ~10-50 ms of latency each, and each billed as a Class B op). A wide tree with a deep replay is hundreds of round trips per commit; the in-DO object cache and pinned bases mitigate but do not remove this.
- DO memory is 128 MB and a single request is bounded by the CPU limit (30 s default, up to 5 min via `limits.cpu_ms`); the alarm-chained `rebase_jobs` cursor exists purely because of that. Very large blobs must be merged by streaming, not loaded.
- Single-DO serialization: a long rebase holds the same DO that serves pushes. Steps are short by design, but throughput on a hot monorepo branch degrades while a job runs (branch-level DOs would help).
- Rewritten commits lose the original committer/author identity unless the client passes them through; the proof hardcodes `git-edge` as author. Signed commits cannot be re-signed server-side without the client's key, so GPG/SSH signatures are dropped on replay.
- No abort/edit/reword interactive semantics; only replay and squash. `rebase-status` exists to poll, not to steer.
