# Semantic diffs via tree-sitter in Wasm

## Mechanism
`GET /:owner/:repo/diff?from=<blob-oid>&to=<blob-oid>&path=foo.rb&semantic=1` is routed by the Worker to the repo DO (`idFromName(owner/repo)`). The DO first checks its SQLite table `semantic_diff(old_oid, new_oid, lang, json)` — blob pairs are immutable, so a hit is final; on a miss it does two `env.BUCKET.get("objects/<oid>")` reads, inflates each loose git object (`"blob <len>\0" + body`) with `DecompressionStream("deflate")`, and parses both bodies with a tree-sitter runtime plus the JS and Ruby grammars statically linked into one `.wasm` that is imported as an ES module (`import ts from "./ts.wasm"`, instantiated with `new WebAssembly.Instance`, which is the only way Workers allow Wasm — no runtime `WebAssembly.compile` from bytes). It walks both syntax trees to a list of `{kind, qualifiedName, byteRange, bodyHash}` for functions/methods/classes/modules, matches by qualified name (rename = same bodyHash under a different name), emits added/removed/modified/renamed entries with a Myers line diff clipped to each modified function's byte range, writes the JSON into `semantic_diff`, and streams it back.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) as a content-addressed result cache — GA
- Wasm modules bundled with the Worker (`import mod from "./x.wasm"` yields a precompiled `WebAssembly.Module`; wrangler rule `{type:"CompiledWasm"}`) — GA
- R2 `get` of loose objects (whole object; no range needed because a blob body must be fully inflated to parse) — GA
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` (zlib-wrapped, which is what git loose objects are) — GA
- `Response` with JSON body; `limits.cpu_ms` in wrangler.jsonc if a parse pair exceeds the 30 s default — GA
- Optional: DO alarm (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) to pre-warm the cache for every changed blob pair right after a push — GA

## Why it works
- A git blob is just bytes; semantic diff needs the full body of both versions, so the DO reads two loose objects (or, with `diff-api-range-reads`, two pack entries) and inflates them with `DecompressionStream("deflate")` — git loose objects are zlib streams with the `"<type> <size>\0"` header inside the compressed payload, which the code strips.
- tree-sitter's core is plain C with no libc dependency beyond `malloc`/`memcpy`; it and the generated `parser.c` for JS and Ruby (including Ruby's external `scanner.c`) compile to `wasm32` with clang and link into one module. Workers instantiate bundled modules with `new WebAssembly.Instance(module, imports)`; the build-time module import avoids the runtime-compile restriction that breaks stock `web-tree-sitter` (its Emscripten loader wants to `WebAssembly.compile` each grammar as a dynamic side module).
- Function matching is by qualified name because that is what a reviewer means by "the diff of `User#save`"; renames are detected by equal body hash, which is exactly `git diff -M` at function rather than file granularity.
- The result is keyed by `(old_oid, new_oid, lang)`; because oids are content hashes, the SQLite cache never invalidates and a repeated request (PR page reload, agent re-query) is one SQLite row read with zero R2 traffic and zero Wasm CPU.
- The same DO already owns the commit -> tree -> blob mapping (`refs-sqlite-objects-r2`), so a commit-pair diff is a tree walk to blob pairs followed by this per-pair routine, and a post-receive alarm can precompute it for every changed `.rb`/`.js` blob before anyone asks.

## Known limits
- Workers forbid `WebAssembly.compile`/`instantiate(bytes)` at runtime, so `web-tree-sitter` as published cannot load grammars; the proof assumes a custom static-link build (tree-sitter core + parsers + a hand-written JS shim over the C ABI, or a Rust `tree-sitter` crate build via wasm-bindgen). That shim (`TreeSitter`, `Node`, `myers`, `fnv1a`) is hand-waved above; it is ~200 lines but not tree-sitter-provided. Passing a precompiled `WebAssembly.Module` into Emscripten's dylink loader may also work but was not verified.
- Wasm linear memory counts against the DO's 128 MB. tree-sitter trees are roughly 20-40x source size; two 2 MB minified JS bundles can exceed it. Cap input at ~1 MB per blob and fall back to a plain line diff above that.
- Parsing is CPU-bound: ~1-5 ms per 10 KB of JS, worse for Ruby's heredoc/regex scanner. A 1 MB pair stays well under the 30 s CPU cap, but a commit touching hundreds of files must fan out across requests or an alarm chain, not one request.
- Bundle size: tree-sitter-javascript's `parser.c` alone produces ~1.2 MB of Wasm, Ruby ~1.8 MB; with the runtime the module is ~3 MB compressed, within the 10 MB paid-plan Worker limit but nontrivial cold-start cost (tens of ms) per isolate.
- One repo DO does all parses for that repo serially; a hot monorepo PR view could queue behind pushes. Mitigation: the pure parse step has no state and can run in the plain Worker with the DO only serving the cache.
- Only JS and Ruby as stated; TS/JSX/ERB need extra grammars and the "name" extraction rules differ per grammar (Ruby `singleton_method` names live under `name`, JS `lexical_declaration` needs the `variable_declarator`). Anonymous functions, `define_method`, and metaprogrammed methods have no static name and fall out as "modified enclosing scope".
- Whole-object R2 GETs (two per uncached pair) and one SQLite write; at $0.36/M class-B ops this is negligible, but the cache table grows unbounded and needs the GC alarm to prune pairs whose blobs are unreachable.
