# Want/have negotiation with a commit-graph in SQLite

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack` with a v2 `command=fetch` body (`want <oid>`, `have <oid>`..., optionally `done`) is forwarded by the stateless Worker to the repo DO (`env.REPO.idFromName("owner/repo")`). The DO keeps the same data git itself keeps in `.git/objects/info/commit-graph` — `commits(oid, gen, tree)` and `parents(oid, parent)` — plus one extra table `introduced(commit, oid)` = "objects reachable from this commit's tree that are not reachable from any parent's tree"; all three are filled at push time by the pack parser (`streaming-pack-parser`), which already inflates every commit and tree. On fetch the DO ACKs each `have` that is a row in `commits`, runs git's own two-colour walk (pop by generation number descending, haves paint their ancestors UNINTERESTING, stop when the frontier is all uninteresting) with `ctx.storage.sql` row lookups instead of R2 GETs, and the send set is one `SELECT DISTINCT oid FROM introduced WHERE commit IN (interesting)`. Only after the set is known does the Worker touch R2, once per object in the set, to stream the `packfile` section; no commit, tree or blob is read from R2 to *decide* what to send. Because v2 clients resend every `have` on every round, each POST is self-contained and the DO stores nothing between rounds.

## Primitives
- Durable Object with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) — GA
- Workers `fetch` with streaming `Response` body (`ReadableStream` / `TransformStream`) — GA
- R2 `env.BUCKET.get("objects/<owner>/<repo>/<sha>")` per object in the send set (bodies only, never for negotiation) — GA
- `nodejs_compat` `node:zlib` `deflateSync` for pack entries and `node:crypto` SHA-1 for the trailing pack checksum — GA
- No alarms, KV, Queues or beta features needed for this idea

## Why it works
- The tables are exactly git's own commit-graph (`oid`, generation number, parents, root tree); git's `upload-pack` on a real server already uses the commit-graph file for `ok_to_give_up` / `can_all_from_reach` so it does not have to parse commit objects during negotiation. Putting that graph in DO SQLite gives the same property on Cloudflare, where "parsing a commit" would otherwise be a ~20-50 ms R2 round trip per step instead of a ~10 us row read.
- Popping in strictly descending generation number is what makes the two-colour walk correct in one pass: a parent always has a smaller generation than every child, so all children (and therefore the parent's final INTERESTING/UNINTERESTING flag) are settled before the parent is popped. This is the same argument git relies on when it prefers generation numbers over commit dates in `revision.c`.
- `introduced(commit, oid)` makes the object set a single set-union instead of a tree walk. Correctness: any object reachable from a want is first "introduced" by some ancestor commit C of that want; if C is interesting it is sent, and if C is uninteresting the client has C and therefore (git's invariant that a `have` implies the full closure) already has the object. Extra duplicates can be sent when the same blob is introduced on two branches, which `git index-pack` accepts silently — git's own pack-objects has the same boundary imprecision.
- Protocol v2 `fetch` is stateless by design: the client resends all `have`s (including previously ACKed ones) on every round, so the DO can compute `ACK`/`ready` from the request alone, and the Worker emits the sections git expects in order: `acknowledgments` (`NAK` or `ACK <oid>`... then `ready`), delim-pkt `0001`, `packfile`, flush `0000`. When the client sent `done` the acknowledgments section is omitted entirely, which is what `git fetch-pack` requires.
- A `have` is ACKed only if it is a row in `commits`; git sends `have` only for commits and the client ignores ACKs for anything it did not ask about, so a stale ACK list cannot desynchronise the negotiation.
- The pack is an ordinary v2 pack (12-byte `PACK` header, per-entry varint type/size header, zlib body, trailing SHA-1); the negotiation layer is independent of whether entries are full objects (here), `OBJ_REF_DELTA` against pinned bases (`pinned-delta-bases`), or a range read of a precomputed pack (`precomputed-clone-pack`).

## Known limits
- `introduced` must be computed at push time by diffing each new commit's tree against its parents' trees. The pushing pack usually contains the new trees, but parent trees must come from R2 (or the DO object cache); a large push of a wide tree can cost hundreds of R2 GETs and real CPU in the receive path. This proof hand-waves that diff (`newObjs` is passed in already computed).
- The `introduced` table has roughly one row per object in the repo (about 60-80 bytes each including indexes). A 5M-object monorepo is ~400 MB of SQLite in one DO — within the 10 GB storage cap but large; `branch-level-dos` would be needed to shard. `commits`/`parents` alone are small (a 1M-commit history is ~150 MB).
- The walk runs in JS inside the DO with one `sql.exec` per parent lookup and a sort per pop; it is fine for tens of thousands of interesting commits but a fetch whose interesting set is the whole history of a 1M-commit repo will hit the 30 s CPU limit and the 128 MB DO isolate limit (the `interesting` array and `color` map). A fresh clone (no haves) should bypass this path via `precomputed-clone-pack`; the `IN (...)` list also needs batching beyond SQLite's 32k bound-parameter limit.
- `ready` is a simplification of git's `ok_to_give_up`; it says ready as soon as every want has been separated from at least one acked have, which can produce a bigger pack than git would after more rounds. Git tolerates this (it is allowed to send a superset).
- Tags (a `want` of an annotated tag needs a `tags(oid, target)` row so the walk starts at the peeled commit), `deepen`/shallow, `filter` (partial clone) and `ref-in-want` are elided.
- Pack building still costs one R2 GET per object in the send set (Class B operation each) plus one `deflateSync` per object; there is no delta compression in this proof so the pack is larger than git's. All of that runs in the Worker per fetch, so a single hot repo is bounded by the single-DO throughput of the negotiate RPC (fast) and by R2 fan-out in the Worker (the real bottleneck).
- The commit graph is only as good as the push path that fills it; an object that arrives outside `recordCommit` (e.g. `presigned-direct-upload`) must still be registered or it will never be sent.
