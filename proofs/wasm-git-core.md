# Wasm git core (gitoxide/libgit2) for delta resolution and merge

## Mechanism
A small Rust crate (`git_core`, built on gitoxide's `gix-pack` delta applier, `gix-object` parsing and `gix-merge`/`imara-diff` blob merging; no `std::fs`, no threads) is compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and shipped inside the Worker bundle as a `CompiledWasm` module (`import wasm from "./git_core.wasm"`), instantiated once per isolate. It exposes only pure "bytes in, bytes out" functions over its linear memory: `apply_delta(base, delta)`, `merge_blob(base, ours, theirs)`, `parse_tree`, `sha1_object`. Two callers use it: (1) the repo DO's `resolvePending(pushId)` step of `two-phase-push` reads a parked `ref-delta`/`ofs-delta` chain from `pending/<pushId>/` and its base from `objects/<sha>` in R2, copies both into Wasm memory, applies the chain, SHA-1s the result and `put`s it to `objects/<sha>`; (2) `server-side-merge` swaps its pure-JS diff3 for `merge_blob`, which produces git-identical conflict markers or a clean merged blob that the Worker writes to R2 before the DO CASes the refs. Because Wasm imports must be synchronous and R2 is async, the TypeScript side does all I/O first (it already knows the base SHA / negative offset from the delta header) and calls into Wasm only with everything resident; the Wasm never calls back out.

## Primitives
- Workers Wasm modules (`rules: [{type:"CompiledWasm", globs:["**/*.wasm"]}]`, `WebAssembly.instantiate(module, imports)` on the imported `WebAssembly.Module`) — GA; runtime `WebAssembly.compile` from bytes is *not* allowed, the module must be a bundle import
- Durable Object with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec` for the `pending_deltas` table) and `ctx.storage.setAlarm` to drain the queue in bounded slices — GA
- R2 `env.BUCKET.get(key)` / `.put(key, bytes)` and `get(key, {range})` for reading a base straight out of a stored pack at a known offset — GA
- `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` (or the Wasm's own sha1; both fine) — GA
- `limits.cpu_ms` in wrangler.jsonc to raise the 30 s default towards 300 s for big delta chains — GA
- Worker script size: 3 MB compressed on Free, 10 MB on Paid; a gitoxide subset (`gix-pack` delta + `gix-object` + `imara-diff`) with `opt-level="z"`, `lto`, `panic="abort"`, `wasm-opt -Oz` lands around 300-600 KB, well inside — GA limit
- Nothing beta is required. (Wasm SIMD is on by default in V8; threads/`SharedArrayBuffer` are not available in Workers, so no `rayon`.)

```

## Why it works
- Delta application is the one part of pack ingest that is pure and CPU-heavy: git's delta format (two size varints, then copy/insert ops) never needs I/O once the base is in hand, so it fits the "host does I/O, Wasm computes" split exactly; `gix-pack::data::delta::apply` is the same code gitoxide uses for real packs.
- `ofs-delta` bases are addressed by a negative byte offset in the same pack, which is precisely what an R2 range read gives you if the parser recorded `<pack-key>@<offset>`; `ref-delta` bases are 20-byte SHAs, i.e. content-addressed R2 keys. Either way the DO can fetch the base without a Wasm callback.
- The type of a delta result is the type of its base, and the object id is `sha1("<type> <len>\0" + content)`; the code preserves both, so resolved objects land at the same `objects/<sha>` the client's `git fsck` will compute.
- `gix-merge`'s text driver reproduces git's `<<<<<<< ours / ======= / >>>>>>> theirs` markers and its conflict-count return value, so `server-side-merge` can reject with `ng <ref> merge conflict` on `conflicts > 0` and otherwise write a blob byte-identical to what `git merge` would have produced locally.
- Instantiating once per isolate and never importing host functions means no Asyncify, no JSPI, no re-entrancy; a resolve slice is a plain synchronous call bounded by the `LIMIT 64` batch and the alarm re-arm.
- The module is bundled by Wrangler as a `WebAssembly.Module`, which is the only way Workers accept Wasm (no runtime `compile` of fetched bytes); this is the GA path and works identically inside a DO and a stateless Worker.

## Known limits
- Not libgit2: libgit2-to-Wasm builds (emscripten "wasm-git") assume a POSIX filesystem and pull in MEMFS, pthreads stubs and libssh2/OpenSSL; the objects here live in R2, so the practical core is a gitoxide *subset*, not a full git library. Full `gix` (repository, odb, refs, config) does not build cleanly for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` today; you pick `gix-pack` delta, `gix-object`, `gix-diff`/`imara-diff`, `gix-merge` blob driver and write your own tree merge on top (the `server-side-merge` proof already has that in TS).
- Memory: Wasm linear memory counts against the isolate's 128 MB, and the base + delta + result are all resident at once, so a 40 MB blob that deltas against a 40 MB base is the ceiling; bigger objects must be stored whole (the pack parser already parks them non-delta) or handled by `native-lfs`.
- CPU: Wasm time counts against the request CPU limit (30 s default, 300 s with `limits.cpu_ms`); the `LIMIT 64` + alarm slicing keeps a pathological push of thousands of deltas from timing out, at the cost of the ref flip waiting for the last alarm.
- No threads, no `memory.grow` beyond the isolate cap, and every `grow` detaches JS views — the helpers re-read `memory.buffer` for that reason; forgetting this is the classic silent-corruption bug.
- R2 cost: each parked delta is one GET for the delta, one GET (or range GET) for the base, one PUT and one DELETE; resolving inside the DO after the push rather than inline in the streaming parser roughly doubles class-A ops for delta-heavy pushes.
- Single-DO throughput: resolution is serialized per repo, so a large push blocks other pushes to the same repo until its alarm chain drains (branch-level-dos would shard this).
- Bundle size: a fat build with `gix-merge` plus its diff algorithms is a few hundred KB compressed; fine on Paid (10 MB), tight-but-OK on Free (3 MB) only if tree-sitter (`semantic-diffs`) is not also bundled.
- Hand-waved: the Rust crate itself is shown as signatures, not built here; error handling (delta overrun, size mismatch) is a return code in practice, and the ofs-delta base slice assumes the base entry is under 1 MB compressed (otherwise loop on range reads).
