# Pull-request review data as git objects under refs/reviews

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/reviews/:id/comments` (JSON `{path,line,body,author}`) hits the Worker, which resolves `idFromName(owner/repo)` and calls `repoDO.appendReviewEvent(id, event)`. The DO reads the current tip of `refs/reviews/<id>` from its SQLite `refs` table, then synthesizes three ordinary git objects in memory — a blob holding the event JSON, a tree that is the previous tip's tree plus `events/<seq>-<ulid>.json` (plus a `meta.json` blob with the reviewed commit SHA, base/head refs, state), and a commit whose sole parent is the previous tip — hashes each with `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` over `"<type> <len>\0<body>"`, deflates them with `CompressionStream("deflate")` and `put`s them to R2 at `objects/<sha[0:2]>/<sha[2:]>` (the loose-object layout), and finally compare-and-swaps the ref and inserts a `commits` row so `want-have-negotiation` sees it. Because the result is a plain fast-forward-only branch of plain git objects, `git fetch origin '+refs/reviews/*:refs/reviews/*'` (or `git clone` with `remote.origin.fetch` extended) carries every comment, approval and state change as a commit, and `git log -p refs/reviews/42` is the review transcript. A client may also `git push origin refs/reviews/42` directly (e.g. offline review, or another forge's export); `git-receive-pack` goes through the normal `two-phase-push` path, and the DO's pre-receive rule for the `refs/reviews/` namespace only requires fast-forward plus a tree shape check (top-level `meta.json`, `events/` directory, no other entries).

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) for the ref CAS and the `commits` graph rows — GA
- DO RPC (`DurableObject` from `cloudflare:workers`) from the Worker — GA
- R2 `put`/`get` of loose objects, keyed by SHA (`content-addressed-r2-keys`) — GA
- Workers WebCrypto `SHA-1` digest (git object ids; SHA-256 repos would swap the algorithm and object-format capability) — GA
- `CompressionStream("deflate")` / `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib loose-object framing — GA in Workers
- Nothing beta is required.

## Why it works
- Git does not care what a ref is called: `ls-refs` (protocol v2) advertises every row in `refs`, and a client fetches `refs/reviews/*` with an explicit refspec exactly as it fetches `refs/pull/*/head` from GitHub today. `refs/reviews/` is not `refs/heads/`, so it never shows up as a branch, is never checked out, and survives `git branch -D`.
- The objects are byte-for-byte what `git hash-object` / `git mktree` / `git commit-tree` would produce: `"<type> <len>\0"` header, SHA-1 over header+body, zlib-deflated loose object. Any pack builder that already serves loose objects from R2 (`streaming-pack-parser` writes them the same way) can send them; `git fsck` on the clone passes.
- Append-only review history maps onto fast-forward commits: each event is one commit with one parent, so `git log refs/reviews/42` is the chronological transcript, `git show` on a commit is the diff of the JSON that changed, and two people committing concurrently is just the ref CAS in the DO rejecting the loser, identical to two concurrent pushes to a branch.
- A clone is self-contained: mirror the repo with `git clone --mirror` and the reviews come with it, because they are reachable objects under an advertised ref. Migrating between forges is `git push --mirror`.
- The pre-receive rule in the DO is enough for client-side pushes: fast-forward is checked against `commits.parents` (already needed by `want-have-negotiation`), and the tree shape check only needs the top-level tree entries, which the push parser already has after inflating the commit and its tree.
- GC (`gc-and-repack-alarm`) walks from every ref, so review objects are protected exactly like code objects; if a PR branch is deleted, `meta.json` still names the reviewed SHA, and keeping that commit reachable is a one-line policy (add the head SHA as a second parent of the first review commit, at the cost of `git log` on the review ref then including code history).

## Known limits
- Extending the `events/` tree re-reads and rewrites the whole tree per event: two R2 GETs and four R2 PUTs per comment, and the tree grows linearly, so a review with 10,000 events has a ~600 KB tree object rewritten every time. Fix is sharding `events/<seq/100>/` (same code, two levels); not shown.
- Loose objects only: no delta compression, so each event costs a separate small R2 object and a clone of a review-heavy repo transfers thousands of tiny objects until `gc-and-repack-alarm` packs them. R2 per-request cost (Class A on put) dominates at ~4 puts per comment.
- Single-DO serialization: every comment on every PR of a repo goes through the one repo DO. Fine for human review rates; an agent swarm commenting at hundreds/s would need `branch-level-dos` sharding by review id.
- Threads, edits and deletions are events, not mutations: a comment is never rewritten, only superseded by a later `edit`/`delete` event referring to its seq. Clients that want a GitHub-style materialized view have to fold the log; the server can cache that view in SQLite but it is not shown.
- Rich UI concepts (line anchoring across force-pushes, suggested changes, CODEOWNERS gating) are policy on top; the events carry `path`/`line` plus the reviewed SHA and nothing more.
- The proof hard-codes SHA-1 and a UTC committer; SHA-256 repos need the `object-format=sha256` capability in `ls-refs` and 32-byte tree entries.
- No `alarm` is needed; all consistency is the ref CAS. The 30 s Worker CPU limit and DO 128 MB memory are far from being hit (objects are KB-sized), unless someone pushes a multi-MB review tree directly, which the tree shape rule does not bound; add a size cap in pre-receive.
