# Search index built on push (D1 FTS / Vectorize)

## Mechanism
`POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack` is handled by the repo DO (`repo-do-ref-authority`); after it has written the pack's objects to R2 and CAS-flipped the refs, it appends one row per updated ref to an `index_jobs` table in its own SQLite and calls `ctx.storage.setAlarm(now)` so the push response goes back to the client before any indexing work starts. The alarm handler pops a job, diffs old-tree vs new-tree by walking tree objects from R2 (only entries whose SHA changed are visited, unchanged subtrees are skipped by tree-SHA equality), inflates each changed blob with `DecompressionStream("deflate")`, and upserts `(path, blob_sha, text)` into an FTS5 virtual table in the same DO SQLite (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`), re-arming the alarm if the budget ran out. `GET /:owner/:repo/search?q=` (or a protocol-v2 `search` command, see `agent-native-commands`) runs `SELECT ... FROM blobs_fts WHERE blobs_fts MATCH ?` in the DO; an optional second stage writes the same chunks to Vectorize via Workers AI embeddings for cross-repo semantic search.

## Primitives
- Durable Object with SQLite storage (GA) — `ctx.storage.sql.exec`, FTS5 virtual tables (FTS5 is an enabled extension in DO SQLite and in D1; if it turns out to be missing in DO SQLite on a given release, the identical DDL runs on D1 via `env.DB.prepare`, at the cost of leaving the DO's transaction boundary)
- DO alarms (GA) — deferred, self-rescheduling post-receive work
- R2 (GA) — `env.BUCKET.get(key)` for tree and blob objects, content-addressed keys
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` (Workers runtime, GA) — zlib-inflate loose git objects
- Workers AI `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` + Vectorize (both GA, Vectorize v2) — optional semantic stage
- D1 (GA) — optional cross-repo FTS index if per-repo DO tables are not enough

## Proof code
```typescript
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

type Env = { BUCKET: R2Bucket; AI: Ai; VEC: VectorizeIndex };
const objKey = (sha: string) => `objects/${sha.slice(0, 2)}/${sha.slice(2)}`;

export class RepoDO extends DurableObject<Env> {
  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);
    ctx.storage.sql.exec(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS refs (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, sha TEXT NOT NULL);
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS index_jobs (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        ref TEXT, old_sha TEXT, new_sha TEXT);
      CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blobs_fts USING fts5(
        path, blob_sha UNINDEXED, body, tokenize='unicode61');`);
  }

  // Called by the receive-pack handler AFTER objects are in R2 and refs are CAS'd.
  // Same SQLite transaction as the ref flip, so a job is never lost or duplicated.
  async postReceive(updates: { ref: string; old: string; new: string }[]) {
    for (const u of updates)
      this.ctx.storage.sql.exec(
        "INSERT INTO index_jobs (ref, old_sha, new_sha) VALUES (?,?,?)", u.ref, u.old, u.new);
    await this.ctx.storage.setAlarm(Date.now()); // fire ASAP, outside the push request
  }

  async alarm() {
    const job = this.ctx.storage.sql
      .exec("SELECT * FROM index_jobs ORDER BY id LIMIT 1").toArray()[0] as any;

      const body = await this.readBlob(sha);
      if (body === null) continue; // binary or > cap: skip
      this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("DELETE FROM blobs_fts WHERE path = ?", path);
      this.ctx.storage.sql.exec(
        "INSERT INTO blobs_fts (path, blob_sha, body) VALUES (?,?,?)", path, sha, body);
      if (Date.now() - started > 20_000) { // stay well under the CPU budget
        await this.ctx.storage.setAlarm(Date.now() + 100); return; // resume later
      }
    }

         FROM blobs_fts WHERE blobs_fts MATCH ? ORDER BY rank LIMIT 50`, q).toArray();

## Why it works
- `git-receive-pack` only requires the server to answer `unpack ok` / `ok refs/heads/x` in pkt-line after refs move; the client does not wait for hooks to finish, so scheduling indexing on a DO alarm mirrors what a real post-receive hook is: fire-and-forget after the ref update.
- The job row and the ref flip live in the same DO SQLite transaction, so "indexed state" never diverges from "ref state" and a crashed alarm is retried by the runtime (alarms retry with backoff until the handler returns without throwing).
- Tree diffing is exactly what `git diff-tree old new` does: compare 20-byte SHAs entry by entry and recurse only into subtrees whose SHA changed, so a one-file push touching a 100k-file monorepo reads O(depth) trees, not the whole tree.
- Blob text is a pure function of `blob_sha`, so re-indexing is idempotent (content-addressed R2 keys from `content-addressed-r2-keys`); a force-push or re-push re-derives the same rows.
- FTS5 with `unicode61` tokenizes identifiers well enough for code search (`snake_case` splits on `_`, `bm25()` ranking is built in), and `snippet()` gives GitHub-style highlighted hits without storing anything extra.

## Known limits
- Index is per repo, inside the repo DO: fine for `grep`-style search within a repo, but cross-repo search needs a fan-out over DOs or a shared D1 FTS table (D1 rows cap at ~1 MB and D1 writes are not transactional with the DO ref flip).
- DO SQLite is capped at 10 GB per DO and 2 MB per row value; FTS5 roughly doubles the stored text size, so large repos need the 512 KB blob cap shown, exclusion of vendored/lock files, or an external D1/Vectorize index. Alarm CPU is bounded (the 30 s wall/CPU budget), hence the 20 s self-reschedule loop.
- Indexing is asynchronous: a `search` immediately after `git push` can miss the last commit; expose `index_jobs` depth as `X-Index-Lag` so callers can wait.
- Only loose objects read from R2 are shown; blobs stored inside packs as `ofs-delta`/`ref-delta` need delta resolution first (`streaming-pack-parser` materializes objects on push, which is what this relies on). If the push was accepted via `precomputed-clone-pack`-style packs only, `readBlob` needs a pack index lookup + R2 range read instead of a single `get`.
- One R2 GET per changed tree and blob: a 10k-file initial push costs ~10k Class B operations and several minutes of alarms; the tree-diff skips this on subsequent pushes.
- Vectorize stage is hand-waved: embeddings via Workers AI cost per token and Vectorize has per-index vector and metadata limits (~5M vectors, 10 KB metadata), so only chunked, deduplicated blobs should go there and it should be a separate alarm job, not part of the FTS loop.
- Deleted files are handled by the `DELETE FROM blobs_fts WHERE path = ?` only when the path reappears; a proper implementation also iterates entries present in `ta` but absent from `tb` (omitted for brevity).
