# Server-side three-way merge in the Worker

## Mechanism
`git push -o merge=main origin feature` lands on `POST /:owner/:repo/git-receive-pack`; because `info/refs` advertised `push-options`, the pkt-line stream is `<old> <new> refs/heads/feature\0report-status push-options side-band-64k`, flush, one pkt-line per option (`merge=main`), flush, then the `PACK`. The Worker runs the normal two-phase push (objects to R2 at `objects/<sha>`, manifest under `pending/`), then, still in the Worker and before touching any ref, reads the current `refs/heads/main` tip from the repo DO, asks the DO for the merge base (walking the `commits(sha, parents)` graph in DO SQLite plus the parents it just parsed out of the pack), and performs a three-way tree merge by reading the base/ours/theirs tree and blob objects from R2 with `DecompressionStream("deflate")`. Trivially resolvable entries are decided at tree level without reading blobs; both-sides-changed text blobs go through a line-based diff3; a real conflict aborts with `ng refs/heads/feature merge conflict: <paths>` and no ref moves. Otherwise the Worker writes the new tree objects and a two-parent merge commit to R2 and hands the DO two ref commands in one atomic `commit()`: `feature: old→new` (as pushed) and `main: observedTip→mergeCommit` (a compare-and-swap); if main moved under it the Worker re-reads the tip and retries the merge a bounded number of times.

## Primitives
- Workers: streaming request body, `DecompressionStream("deflate")` / `CompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib loose objects, `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1")` — GA
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) for refs and the commit graph; DO RPC stub methods — GA
- DO alarms only indirectly (the two-phase-push janitor sweeps merge objects written by a Worker that lost its CAS retries) — GA
- R2 `get`/`put` of loose objects, content-addressed keys, idempotent — GA
- A pure-JS diff3 (`node-diff3`, `diff3Merge`) bundled into the Worker; no Wasm needed for this proof — not a Cloudflare primitive, no GA question
- Nothing beta is required.

## Proof code

## Why it works
- `push-options` is a real receive-pack capability (Documentation/gitprotocol-pack: after the command list and its flush, each option is one pkt-line, then a flush, then the pack), so `git push -o merge=main` reaches the Worker with no client patch; servers that do not advertise it never see the section. The client only ever names `refs/heads/feature` in its commands, so success/failure is reported against that ref (`ok`/`ng refs/heads/feature ...`); git's `send-pack` rejects status lines for refs it did not ask about, which is why main's outcome rides on feature's line and, optionally, a band-2 sideband progress message.
- Git's merge is a function of three trees and a merge base; the base comes from the commit graph, which the repo DO already holds in SQLite for want/have negotiation, and the pushed commits' parents are known from the pack the Worker just inflated, so no commit object is read from R2 to find the base. The lockstep BFS returns a common ancestor; for a single merge base it is exactly `git merge-base`.
- The tree-level rules (same-on-both, changed-on-one-side, recurse-on-both-dirs) are the trivial-merge table from `git merge-tree`/merge-ort; they resolve the overwhelming majority of paths by sha comparison alone, so a merge touches R2 only for the trees on the changed spine and the blobs that both sides edited. A 10-file change in a 50k-file repo is a few dozen GETs.
- The Worker writes loose objects exactly as git does (`"<type> <size>\0"` + body, SHA-1 over that, zlib) and sorts tree entries with the directory-as-"name/" rule, so the resulting merge commit is byte-for-byte what `git merge --no-ff` would produce given the same author/timestamp, and a subsequent `git fetch` from any client verifies it.
- Because objects are content-addressed and written before any ref moves, the merge is speculative: main's advance is a plain compare-and-swap on the DO (`old: ours`) inside the same atomic `commit()` as the feature update, so a concurrent push to main makes the CAS fail with `fetch first`, the Worker retries against the new tip, and nothing half-merged is ever visible. A merge abandoned after three retries leaves only unreachable objects, which the two-phase-push janitor already sweeps.
- "Reject only on real conflicts" maps to: text regions diff3 cannot resolve, binary blobs edited on both sides, modify/delete, file/directory, add/add with different content, and unrelated histories (`mergeBase` null). Everything else is accepted without the client ever having to fetch main.

## Known limits
- Merge is done in the Worker, not the DO, so it runs in the Worker's 128MB isolate under the 30s CPU default: every both-sides-edited blob is fully inflated and split into lines in memory. A push that touches a multi-MB generated file on both sides can blow either limit; the fallback is to reject with `merge conflict` rather than crash, but that is a false conflict.
- No rename detection. git's default merge-ort detects renames so an edit on one side and a rename on the other merges cleanly; this proof reports modify/delete. Rename detection needs similarity scoring across all added/deleted blobs and is where the Wasm core (`wasm-git-core`) earns its place.
- Only one merge base is used. With criss-cross history git computes a virtual recursive base; the lockstep BFS just returns whichever common ancestor it meets first, so some merges git would resolve cleanly are rejected here (never the reverse in a dangerous direction: a rejection is always safe, but an acceptance could differ from git's textual result at conflict-adjacent hunks because `node-diff3` and git's xdiff choose hunk boundaries differently).
- `mergeBase` runs inside the DO and walks the commit graph with one SQLite `SELECT` per commit; on a long-diverged branch (thousands of commits) that is tens of milliseconds during which the repo takes no other request. Fine for the common case, not for a stale year-old branch on a busy monorepo.
- R2 GETs on the changed spine plus one PUT per new tree/blob/commit; deep trees mean one round trip per directory level per side (base/ours/theirs), so latency is depth-bound (roughly 3 x depth sequential GETs, though siblings are fetched in parallel).
- Author/committer identity is hand-waved as an `x-git-user` header set by the auth layer; `auth-and-multitenancy` needs to provide a real name/email, and the merge commit is unsigned, which conflicts with a signed-by-default policy (`signed-reflog`) unless the server holds a signing key.
- `commit()` is assumed to accept a list of commands and apply them atomically (both feature and main, or neither); the two-phase-push proof leaves atomic-across-refs as a one-line option, so this is a real, if small, change to its interface.
- Submodule entries (mode `160000`) and symlinks (`120000`) are only merged by sha equality; both-sides-changed falls to conflict. Mode-only changes on one side with content edits on the other are treated as conflicts rather than combined.
- The sideband message "merged into main as <sha>" is not shown in the code; without it the user sees only `ok refs/heads/feature` and must `git fetch` to learn main's new tip.
