# Blame that knows which agent wrote each line

## Mechanism
Agents commit with ordinary git trailers (`Agent-Session: session_01MF…`, `Agent-Model: claude-fable-5-1`), which git already parses (`git interpret-trailers`, `%(trailers:key=Agent-Session)`); nothing about the pack or the wire changes. During the commit step of the two-phase push the repo DO (`idFromName("owner/repo")`) already has every new commit object inflated to fill its `commits(sha, parents)` graph, so it additionally splits the message's last paragraph into trailers and writes `commit_agent(sha, session, model, attested)` in DO SQLite, marking `attested=1` only when the pushing token was itself scoped to that session id. An agent then POSTs `command=blame` (args `path`, `rev`) to `POST /:owner/:repo/git-upload-pack` in pkt-line framing; the Worker asks the DO for a per-path blame that is computed incrementally along first-parent history (blame(C) = blame(parent) + one Myers diff of the two blobs read from R2 `objects/<sha>` via `DecompressionStream("deflate")`) and memoised in a `blame_memo(path, commit, lines)` table, then streams back one pkt-line per line: `<commit> <session|human> <model|-> <lineno> <text>`.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) for `commit_agent`, `blame_memo` and the existing `commits` graph — GA
- DO RPC (`stub.blame()`, `stub.recordTrailers()`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) to finish a cold blame of a long-lived file in the background when the inline budget is exceeded — GA
- R2 `env.BUCKET.get("objects/<sha>")` for the blob at each revision — GA
- Workers streaming `Response` over `TransformStream` + `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for loose objects — GA
- Nothing beta; no AI, no Vectorize

## Why it works
- Trailers are a real git feature, not an invention: `git commit --trailer "Agent-Session=…"` writes them, `git log --format=%(trailers:key=Agent-Session,valueonly)` reads them, and `git interpret-trailers` defines the parse (last paragraph, `Token: value`, folded continuations). The commit object on the wire is unchanged, so `git push` from any agent harness works and a plain `git blame --porcelain` plus that `git log` format gives the same answer client-side.
- The server sees every new commit inflated exactly once, in the two-phase-push commit step that already fills the `commits(sha, parents)` graph for want/have negotiation; parsing the trailer there costs a string split, no extra R2 read.
- Blame is defined incrementally: for a first-parent chain, a line unchanged by the diff `blob(parent) -> blob(C)` keeps its attribution, an inserted line is attributed to `C`. That is what `git blame` does before its rename/copy heuristics, and memoising per `(path, commit)` means each revision is diffed once ever; a blame of `HEAD` after one new push is one R2 blob read and one diff.
- The `blame` command rides the v2 extension rules (`gitprotocol-v2`: clients MUST ignore unknown capabilities, requests are `command=<name>` + args), so `git clone`/`fetch` are untouched and an agent uses the same `POST git-upload-pack`, same auth, same pkt-line parser as `fetch`.
- Attestation is honest about trust: the trailer is client-asserted, so the DO marks it `attested` only when the pushing token (`scoped-token-remotes`) was issued to that same session id; the response prints `session?` for unverified claims.

## Known limits
- Attribution is first-parent only and ignores renames, copies and `-M/-C` movement detection; a line that moved across files is credited to the commit that moved it. Merge commits credit the merge to whichever side is not first-parent. This is "blame that knows which agent" for the common agent workflow (linear branches), not a full `git blame` reimplementation.
- Cold blame of a file with thousands of revisions needs one R2 GET and one diff per revision; the inline budget is 64 revisions (fits a 30 s CPU Worker/DO request), the rest finishes in a DO alarm chain and the agent gets `status pending` and must re-ask. Memo rows are `JSON` of the whole file per (path, commit): for a 10k-line file touched 1k times that is ~1 GB of SQLite, so the memo needs an eviction policy (keep tips only); hand-waved here.
- A single DO serialises all blame computation for the repo alongside pushes; a fleet of agents blaming different files at once queue on it (`branch-level-dos` would not help, blame is per-repo state).
- Trailer truth is only as good as the token binding: unscoped tokens produce `session?` and a lying agent can claim any session id. A human squashing agent commits loses the trailers unless they carry them forward.
- Real `git` cannot issue `command=blame`; only an agent client with a pkt-line writer can. The client-side equivalent (`git blame --porcelain` + trailer lookup) needs a clone, which is exactly what zero-clone agents want to avoid.
- Whole blobs are inflated into DO memory per revision (128 MB isolate limit); the proof does not handle files over a few tens of MB or binary files (should return an empty blame).
