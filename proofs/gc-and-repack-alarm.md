# GC and repack as a DO alarm

## Mechanism
Every ref update on the repo DO (the `commit` step of two-phase push) bumps `refs_version` and arms `ctx.storage.setAlarm()` for a quiet window (e.g. 10 min after the last push); the alarm never needs an HTTP request. `alarm()` runs a resumable three-phase state machine persisted in DO SQLite: **mark** walks reachability from the `refs` table purely through the `objects(sha, type, links)` index that pushes already populate (zero R2 reads), inserting into a `marked` table in bounded batches; **pack** streams each marked object out of R2 (`objects/<sha>`, loose zlib), re-encodes it as a non-delta pack entry (varint type/size header + zlib body) into an R2 multipart upload at `packs/<repo>/<buildId>.pack` while a serialisable SHA-1 state accumulates the trailer; **sweep** deletes unmarked, pre-GC-timestamp objects from R2 in batches of 1000 and drops their index rows. Each alarm invocation does a bounded slice of work, writes its cursor (and multipart `uploadId`, part list, SHA-1 state) to SQLite, and re-arms `setAlarm(Date.now())` to continue, so a repack of any size survives the per-invocation CPU limit and DO eviction. When the pack is complete its trailer and covered ref tips are recorded so `precomputed-clone-pack` serves it, and older packs are deleted.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `alarm()`, automatic retry on throw) — GA
- R2 `get` (streamed body), `delete(string[])` up to 1000 keys per call — GA
- R2 multipart upload (`createMultipartUpload`, `resumeMultipartUpload(key, uploadId)`, `uploadPart`, `complete`) — GA; parts min 5 MiB except last
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` / `CompressionStream("deflate")` (zlib framing, which is what git uses for both loose and pack objects) — GA
- `nodejs_compat` is *not* needed: `node:crypto` hashes cannot export state, so a small pure-JS SHA-1 with serialisable state is used instead
- Nothing beta.

## Why it works
- Git GC is exactly mark-and-sweep from the ref tips; because `two-phase-push` records each object's outgoing edges (commit→tree/parents, tree→entries) in the `objects` index at commit time, reachability is a pure SQLite graph walk with no R2 reads, and it is trivially resumable (the `marked.done` flag is the frontier).
- The output is a byte-exact git packfile: `PACK`, version 2, big-endian object count, then entries whose first byte packs type (bits 4-6) and the low 4 size bits with a continuation bit, then zlib bodies; commits-then-trees-then-blobs is git's own ordering so `precomputed-clone-pack` can carve a `blobless` slice by offset. Only non-delta entries are emitted, which any `git index-pack` accepts.
- The pack trailer is SHA-1 over the preceding bytes; keeping the hash state in SQLite means it is computed once while streaming and stored, so the pack can be served with the trailer appended and no second pass.
- Sweep only deletes objects with `created_at < gc.started` and unmarked, so objects landed by pushes during the GC (still pending or newly committed) are never touched; that is the same "grace period" rule as `git prune --expire`.
- The `refs_version` check before sweep closes git's classic race (a push that resurrects an orphaned commit between mark and prune): if any ref moved, the stale mark set is discarded and the walk restarts rather than deleting.
- Loose objects remain in R2 after repack, so readers never race a pack swap; deleting them is just the sweep of the *next* GC after a pack build records them as covered, which is how git handles `.keep`/ordering too.

## Known limits
- No delta compression: the "repack" concatenates full zlib objects, so the pack is as large as the loose set. Real ofs-delta generation needs a delta encoder (`wasm-git-core`) and a window search, which does not fit a 30 s CPU alarm without heavy chunking; this proof only reclaims R2 keys and produces a clone-servable pack.
- Every marked object is re-inflated and re-deflated once (loose header must be stripped). Storing loose objects already in pack-entry form (`content-addressed-r2-keys` variant) would make repack a pure byte copy.
- Alarm CPU limit (30 s default, up to 5 min with `limits.cpu_ms`) and the 128 MB DO memory bound the batch: `BATCH=500` objects and a 5 MiB part buffer per invocation; `gc.buf` as a JSON number array is wasteful (should be base64 or an R2 scratch key) and is a placeholder.
- R2 cost: one GET per reachable object per repack plus one PUT per 5 MiB part; a 1M-object repo repack is ~1M Class B ops. Should be gated on churn (e.g. loose count > N) rather than every quiet window.
- Single-DO throughput: the alarm shares the DO with pushes. Each invocation is short and yields, but a large mark walk adds latency to concurrent `commit` calls; the DO's input gate keeps it correct, not fast.
- `resumeMultipartUpload` uploads expire (R2 aborts incomplete multipart uploads after ~7 days by default); a GC that stalls that long must restart the pack phase.
- Open (uncommitted) pushes must be added as mark roots or excluded by `created_at`; handled by the timestamp here but not the manifest-root case, which is hand-waved.
- The pure-JS serialisable SHA-1 is asserted, not shown; `node:crypto` cannot export hash state.

## Depends on
- repo-do-ref-authority
- refs-sqlite-objects-r2
- content-addressed-r2-keys
- two-phase-push (supplies the `objects` index with links and `created_at`)
- precomputed-clone-pack (consumer of the produced pack and stored trailer)
