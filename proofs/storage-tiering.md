# Storage tiering by heat

## Mechanism
R2 is always the system of record (every object and pack lives at its content-addressed key); "tiering" is three read paths over one canonical copy plus a heat ledger. Every read the per-repo `RepoDO` performs on behalf of `git-upload-pack` (a pack slice for `fetch`, a loose object for delta-base lookup, `object-info`) goes through `RepoDO.read(key)`, which bumps `heat(key).last_touch` in DO SQLite and serves from: (1) HOT — a `hot` BLOB table in `ctx.storage.sql` holding pack-ready entries under 512 KiB; (2) WARM — `env.BUCKET.get(key, { range })` on R2 Standard; (3) COLD — the same `get` on an object whose `storageClass` is `"InfrequentAccess"`, which R2 serves with no rehydration delay but bills retrieval per GB. One DO alarm runs nightly: rows untouched for `HOT_TTL` are simply deleted from `hot` (R2 already has the bytes, so demotion is a `DELETE`, never a copy); keys untouched for `COLD_AFTER` and larger than `COLD_MIN_BYTES` are re-put with `storageClass: "InfrequentAccess"` by streaming `get().body` into `put()` since the Workers binding has no copy/change-class call. Promotion is the mirror: a COLD key touched `PROMOTE_HITS` times inside `PROMOTE_WINDOW` is re-put as `"Standard"` (hysteresis, because IA charges a 30-day minimum), and any WARM/COLD hit under the size cap is admitted to `hot`.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects, SQLite-backed (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, BLOB columns, `heat` ledger) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm` / `alarm()`) for the nightly sweep — GA
- R2 binding `get` with `range`, `put` with `storageClass: "Standard" | "InfrequentAccess"`, `head().storageClass` — R2 is GA; the **Infrequent Access storage class is still marked beta** in Cloudflare docs (no SLA, pricing published)
- R2 lifecycle rules `storageClassTransitions` (age-since-upload only; used as a safety net, not the mechanism) — same beta caveat
- Response streams (`ReadableStream` piped from `R2ObjectBody.body` into `put`, and into the `packfile` section of the v2 fetch reply) — GA

const HOT_TTL       = 6 * 3600_000;          // untouched 6h -> drop from DO (R2 still has it)
const COLD_AFTER    = 45 * 86_400_000;       // untouched 45d -> InfrequentAccess (IA bills 30d minimum)
const COLD_MIN      = 1024 * 1024;           // IA ops cost ~2-3x Standard; only worth it for packs, not loose objs
const PROMOTE_HITS  = 3, PROMOTE_WINDOW = 3600_000;  // hysteresis so a single git log doesn't flap a pack
const SWEEP_MS      = 24 * 3600_000;

## Why it works
- `git-upload-pack` never sees a tier: the `packfile` section of a v2 `fetch` response is a `PACK` header + entries + trailing SHA-1 regardless of whether an entry's bytes came from a SQLite BLOB, an R2 Standard range read, or an IA object. Entries are stored in their on-the-wire form (type/size varint + zlib), so no re-inflate/re-deflate happens on the hot path — same trick `in-do-object-cache` relies on.
- R2 IA has no restore step (unlike S3 Glacier), so a `have`/`want` negotiation that lands on a 2-year-old pack still answers in one round trip; cold only changes cost and a few ms of latency, never correctness or protocol timing (git clients have no timeout on the `packfile` section but will hang on a `sideband` stall).
- Content-addressed keys make the class change idempotent: re-`put` of the same bytes at the same key is safe if the alarm is retried, and a concurrent `fetch` reading the old object during the swap gets identical content.
- DO SQLite is the only place with a `last_touch` — R2 exposes `uploaded`, not last-access — so heat must be tracked by the DO that serves reads anyway; the ledger write rides on the same single-threaded DO that already serialises ref updates (`repo-do-ref-authority`).
- Demotion out of the DO costs nothing but a `DELETE`, because the DO tier is a cache over R2, never the owner. This is what keeps the "DO 10 GB / 2 MB per row" limits from ever being a data-loss concern.
- Hysteresis (`PROMOTE_HITS` inside `PROMOTE_WINDOW`, `COLD_AFTER` > IA's 30-day minimum) makes the tiering monotone under normal git traffic: a repo that is cloned once a quarter pays IA storage, one that is cloned daily never leaves Standard.

## Known limits
- As stated ("untouched objects migrate to IA, hot objects stay in DO") the idea is only half true in practice: R2 IA saves $0.005/GB-month over Standard but charges ~2-3x per operation plus $0.01/GB retrieval, so per-loose-object tiering *loses* money; the proof tiers only keys >= 1 MiB (packs, `precomputed-clone-pack` slices) and treats DO as a read cache rather than a storage tier. DO SQLite storage is ~13x the price of R2 per GB, so "stays in DO" is a latency win, not a cost win.
- R2 Infrequent Access is beta; the `storageClass` option and `R2Object.storageClass` are in the binding today but have no SLA.
- No copy/set-storage-class call in the Workers binding: warm<->cold moves stream the whole object through the DO. A 1 GB pack costs a Class A put and a full read; the alarm caps itself at 50 keys/night to stay within the 30 s CPU budget (IO is not CPU, but 50 x 1 GB is hours of wall time and DO alarm invocations are not meant for that — chunked multipart copy or the S3 `CopyObject` API with `x-amz-storage-class` from a plain Worker would be the real implementation).
- Heat lives only in the DO's SQLite; if `heat` rows are lost (repo DO recreated from `refs-sqlite-objects-r2` R2 state) every object is assumed warm and a rescan via `BUCKET.list()` + `head().storageClass` is needed to rebuild the ledger.
- Hot admissions are synchronous `arrayBuffer()` + SQLite insert on the read path; a burst of 10k distinct small objects (a full `git log -p`) will churn the `hot` table. A byte budget / LRU cap as in `in-do-object-cache` is needed and hand-waved here.
- R2 lifecycle `storageClassTransitions` fire on age-since-upload, so they cannot express "untouched since last read"; they are only useful as a backstop for repos whose DO never wakes.
- All reads of one repo funnel through one DO (single-DO throughput, ~hundreds of req/s); the `heat` UPDATE per read is cheap but is one more row write billed per fetch.
