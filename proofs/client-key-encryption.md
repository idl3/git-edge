# Encrypted-at-rest with client-held keys

## Mechanism
A stock `git push https://` cannot do this: git-receive-pack hands the server a plaintext packfile, and the server must inflate it to know what it holds. So the wire protocol changes at the client edge: a small remote helper (`git-remote-edge`, same shape as `git-remote-gcrypt`) or the browser client from `offline-browser-client` encrypts every loose object with a repo key that never leaves the client, `PUT`s each ciphertext to the Worker, which streams it straight into R2 under `<repo>/enc/<oid>`; then it `POST`s a hash-only manifest (ref CAS triples, commit oids with parent oids, and the oids each commit introduced) to the per-repo DO. The DO stores that manifest in SQLite (`refs`, `commits`) and does connectivity + compare-and-swap purely in hash space; on fetch it walks the `commits` table from wants to haves and returns oid lists, and the client pulls ciphertexts from R2 and decrypts them locally. Neither the Worker nor the DO ever holds a key or a plaintext byte; the only things the server learns are ref names, object ids and the commit DAG shape.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql`, `transactionSync`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) for sweeping ciphertexts that never got referenced by a push — GA
- R2 `put` with a streamed request body, `head`, `get` — GA
- Worker `fetch` handler as the stateless upload/download edge in front of R2 — GA
- WebCrypto (`crypto.subtle` AES-GCM + HMAC) on the client side; the same API exists in Workers but is deliberately not used there — GA

## Proof code
```typescript
// ---------- client side: runs wherever the key lives (git-remote-edge helper) ----------
// `git push edge::https://git-edge.dev/o/acme/app main` invokes this instead of git-receive-pack.
type Keys = { aes: CryptoKey; mac: CryptoKey };            // HKDF(repoKey) -> AES-256-GCM key + HMAC-SHA256 key
const enc = (s: string) => new TextEncoder().encode(s);

async function seal(k: Keys, oid: string, type: string, plain: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  // Deterministic nonce per (repo, oid). oid == sha1(type+len+plain), so equal plaintext -> equal
  // ciphertext (idempotent retries, dedup) and distinct plaintext never reuses a nonce under this key.
  const iv = new Uint8Array(await crypto.subtle.sign("HMAC", k.mac, enc(oid))).slice(0, 12);
  const header = enc(`${type} ${plain.length}\0`);                       // same header git hashes
  const ct = await crypto.subtle.encrypt({ name: "AES-GCM", iv, additionalData: enc(oid) }, k.aes,
    new Uint8Array([...header, ...plain]));
  return new Uint8Array([...iv, ...new Uint8Array(ct)]);
}

    oid: c,
    parents: sh(`git rev-list --parents -n1 ${c}`)[0].split(" ").slice(1),
    introduced: sh(`git rev-list --objects ${c} ^${c}^@`),                 // objects first seen in c, hashes only
  }));

## Why it works
- Git's server-side invariants are all expressible over hashes: a ref update is a compare-and-swap on an oid, and "connectivity" is "every parent oid is known". The DO enforces both from the manifest without ever opening an object, and returns the same `fetch first` / non-fast-forward failure a stale push gets from git-receive-pack.
- Object ids remain sha1 of the plaintext (`type len\0body`), computed by git on the client. On fetch the client decrypts and runs `git hash-object -w -t <type>`, which recomputes the id; a tampered or mis-keyed ciphertext fails AES-GCM authentication (oid is bound in as AAD) or produces a different id, so the server cannot silently substitute objects.
- Deterministic nonces derived from HMAC(key, oid) make sealing idempotent, so a retried push re-uploads byte-identical ciphertext and `content-addressed-r2-keys` idempotency still holds.
- The `introduced` list per commit is exactly what `git rev-list --objects c ^c^@` yields, so a fetch is one DO round trip for the oid closure plus N R2 GETs; no server-side tree walking is required and the server never needs to parse a tree.
- Refs and the commit DAG stay in DO SQLite, which is the same shape as `refs-sqlite-objects-r2` and `want-have-negotiation`; encryption changes only what R2 holds and who may read it.

## Known limits
- Not compatible with unmodified `git push`/`git fetch` over smart HTTP. The idea as stated ("objects encrypted before reaching R2") requires a client-side component: a remote helper (as git-remote-gcrypt does) or the shared Wasm core in a browser. Stock clients would need server-side encryption, which is not client-held keys.
- No packfiles: each object is a separate R2 PUT/GET (Class A/B request costs) and there is no delta compression between objects, so clone of a large history is many requests. Batching several sealed objects into one R2 object with a client-side offset index is the obvious fix and is still hash-only for the server.
- The server learns metadata: ref names, object ids, commit parent edges, per-commit object counts and ciphertext sizes. Ref names could be HMACed and sizes padded; this proof does not do either. Anyone who knows the plaintext of a file can confirm its presence from its oid (convergent encryption within one repo key).
- The DO trusts the manifest: a key holder can claim `introduced` objects that are not the true closure of the commit, leaving a fetcher with missing objects. Only key holders can push, so this is a self-inflicted corruption, not a server compromise, but the server cannot fsck.
- `BUCKET.head` per introduced object inside the push handler is serial and sits in the single repo DO; a push of 50k objects would blow well past comfortable request time. Move existence checks to the Worker on PUT (insert into `pending` via DO RPC) and let the push only verify against that table.
- Key management (rotation, sharing with collaborators, CI) is entirely outside the server and is hand-waved here; re-keying means re-sealing every object.
- Server-side features that need plaintext (`server-side-merge`, `search-index-on-push`, `diff-api-range-reads`, `semantic-diffs`) are impossible on an encrypted repo.

## Depends on
- repo-do-ref-authority
- refs-sqlite-objects-r2
- content-addressed-r2-keys
- two-phase-push
- want-have-negotiation
- offline-browser-client (or an equivalent remote helper; needed for any real client)
