# Federated remotes via DO-to-DO gossip

## Mechanism
Every repo DO keeps a `peers` table (peer repo name, or an `https://` smart-HTTP URL for a foreign deployment) and an append-only `outbox`. When `git push` reaches `RepoDO.commit()` (phase two of the two-phase push), the ref compare-and-swap and the outbox insert `{origin, seq, ref, old, new}` happen in one `transactionSync`, and `setAlarm(now)` is armed. The alarm drains the outbox by calling `peerStub.gossip(msg)` over DO RPC (`env.REPO.idFromName(peer)`); the receiving DO dedupes on `(origin, seq)`, makes sure the new tip is reachable in its object store (same-bucket peers: an R2 `head` on the content-addressed key; foreign peers: one protocol-v2 `fetch want=<new> have=<old>` against the origin URL, streamed through the pack parser into R2), then writes the tip to `refs/remotes/<origin>/<ref>` in its own SQLite and re-enqueues the message for its own peers minus the `path` it already travelled. A second, slow alarm performs anti-entropy: it picks a random peer, exchanges `ls-refs` digests, and enqueues whatever differs, so a dropped RPC cannot leave a mirror permanently stale.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `alarm()`) with at-least-once delivery for outbox drain and anti-entropy — GA
- DO RPC (`DurableObject` subclass methods called on a stub: `env.REPO.get(id).gossip(...)`) — GA
- Same-account DO namespace addressing via `idFromName("owner/repo")` — GA; cross-account/cross-deployment peers cannot be reached by RPC and fall back to smart-HTTP `fetch()` over the public Worker
- R2 (`head`/`put` on `objects/<sha>` content-addressed keys shared by all repos of one deployment) — GA
- `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for inflating the PACK a foreign peer returns — GA
- Workers `fetch()` to a foreign git-edge deployment — GA

## Why it works
- A push is only acknowledged (`ok <ref>` in the report-status pkt-lines) after `commit()` returns, and the outbox rows are written in the same SQLite transaction as the ref CAS, so "ref moved" and "peers will hear about it" are atomic; the DO alarm is at-least-once, and `(origin, seq)` dedupe on the receiver makes redelivery harmless.
- Mirrors land tips in `refs/remotes/<origin>/<branch>`, which is precisely what `git fetch <remote>` does on a client; a mirror's own `refs/heads/*` are never rewritten by gossip, so local pushes and federated updates cannot race, and a client cloning the mirror sees the federation as ordinary remote-tracking refs (`ls-refs ref-prefix refs/remotes/`).
- Within one deployment all repos share one content-addressed bucket (`objects/<sha>`), so a ref update is fully described by the 40-byte SHA: the receiver only has to `head` the tip object, and connectivity is the same check the origin already made before accepting the push.
- Across deployments the receiver becomes a normal protocol-v2 client: `command=fetch`, `want <new>`, `have <old>`, `done` gets back exactly the delta pack (`PACK` header, ofs-delta against objects it already holds), which the existing streaming pack parser indexes into R2 unchanged.
- Flood + `path` exclusion + hop cap bounds the message count per update to roughly the number of edges in the mesh, and the periodic `ls-refs` digest exchange is the standard anti-entropy repair, so the mesh converges even if an RPC is lost or a DO is evicted mid-drain.

## Known limits
- No hub means no arbiter: if two peers each push a different `main`, neither wins. The proof sidesteps this by mirroring into tracking refs only; a "fast-forward-only mirror of `refs/heads/*`" policy is possible (check `old == current` before overwriting, else record a `diverged` row) but true multi-master on the same branch needs `crdt-branches` or `cross-repo-atomic-push`, and is out of scope here.
- DO RPC only reaches DOs in the same namespace binding, i.e. the same deployment/account. Cross-account federation degrades to HTTPS between two edge Workers plus a real pack fetch; the `seq` dedupe and `path` list still work but you pay R2 PUTs for every copied object.
- Foreign-origin object fetches run inside `gossip()` on the receiving DO: a large first sync can exceed the DO's 128 MB memory or the 30 s CPU budget unless the pack is streamed in chunks with the alarm re-arming between them (the proof hand-waves this in `indexPackIntoR2`).
- Every ref update costs one alarm wake, N RPCs (N = peers) and up to E forwardings across the mesh; a repo with hundreds of peers or a hot branch (CI bots pushing every few seconds) makes the single origin DO the throughput bottleneck. Batch the outbox per peer (one RPC carrying many `Msg`) before that matters.
- `seen` grows one row per (origin, seq) forever; a janitor alarm should truncate it below the smallest seq every peer is known to have (or bound it to a time window). The anti-entropy `seq: -Date.now()` synthetic messages never collide with real seqs but are never garbage-collected either.
- Anti-entropy is one random peer per 5 minutes, so a partition heals in O(peers * 5 min) rather than immediately; tune per mesh size.
- Peer registration (`INSERT INTO peers`) has no auth in the proof; `auth-and-multitenancy` must gate who may make repo A subscribe to repo B, otherwise anyone can make you mirror anything.
