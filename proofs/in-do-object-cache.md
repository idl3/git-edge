# Tiny in-DO object cache with alarm-driven eviction

## Mechanism
Every object read that is not a bulk clone (protocol v2 `fetch` with `filter blob:none` follow-ups, `object-info`, the raw `/raw/<oid>` API, and delta-base lookups) goes through `RepoDO.getObject(oid)` in the per-repo Durable Object. It checks an in-isolate `Map` first, then a SQLite table `objcache` in `ctx.storage.sql`, and only then does `env.BUCKET.get("objects/<oid>")` on R2; objects up to 512 KiB are admitted into both tiers on miss. What is cached is the *pack-ready* encoding (pack entry header varint + zlib stream), so a hit can be spliced byte-for-byte into an outgoing `PACK` without recompressing. A single DO alarm fires every 5 minutes, flushes batched hit counters, and deletes rows whose `last_hit` is older than the TTL or that fall outside the byte budget in LRU order; the memory tier is dropped to whatever SQLite kept.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite-backed storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, BLOB columns) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm` / `alarm()`) — GA
- R2 (`env.BUCKET.get` by content-addressed key, `arrayBuffer()`) — GA
- Workers `CompressionStream("deflate")` / `DecompressionStream("deflate")` — GA (zlib-wrapped deflate is what git uses)
- `ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile` to arm the first alarm before serving — GA
- Response streams for serving raw blobs — GA

## Why it works
- A git pack entry for an undeltified object is exactly `varint(type,size) || zlib(content)`; caching that form means a `fetch` response to a partial-clone client (`filter blob:none` then `want <blob-oid>`) is `PACK` header (`"PACK"`, version 2, count) + concatenated cached entries + SHA-1 trailer, no recompression on the hit path.
- The zlib stream stored in R2 for a loose object is already the pack-compatible `deflate` (zlib-wrapped) format, so the miss path does a single `arrayBuffer()` and a header prepend; nothing is inflated unless the raw API asks for it, and then `DecompressionStream("deflate")` handles the zlib wrapper natively.
- Refs never live in this table (they are the DO's SQLite ref table, `refs-sqlite-objects-r2`), so eviction can never make the repo inconsistent: every cached row is immutable, content-addressed, and re-fetchable from R2 by the same key.
- Hot small blobs are what lazy/partial clones and tooling hammer (`git sparse-checkout`, `object-info size`, package managers reading manifests), and those are precisely the reads that go through the DO one object at a time; bulk clone bypasses the cache and streams from R2 (`precomputed-clone-pack`).
- Batching `last_hit` in memory and flushing in the alarm keeps a cache hit at zero SQLite writes; SQLite writes are what DO billing counts, reads are cheap.
- Alarms are at-least-once and survive DO eviction, so the sweep runs even if the DO has been idle; `blockConcurrencyWhile` re-arms it on cold start so a wiped alarm cannot leave the table growing forever.

## Known limits
- The memory tier is per-isolate and vanishes on DO eviction/hibernation or any alarm sweep; the SQLite tier is the real cache. DO isolates are capped at 128 MB, so `BUDGET` for the memory map must stay far below that (the code clears it rather than budgeting it separately).
- SQLite-backed DO storage caps a single value at 2 MB and total storage at 10 GB per DO; `MAX_ENTRY` is set well under that. Objects larger than 512 KiB always go to R2 on every read.
- Admission is by oid, size and recency, not by path. The idea says "package.json, lockfiles" but the cache does not know filenames; it knows which small oids are read repeatedly. Filename-aware prewarming would need a tree walk on push (`speculative-packs` territory) and is not proven here.
- One alarm per DO. `gc-and-repack-alarm`, `alarm-chain-ci`, `ephemeral-repos` all want the same alarm slot, so a real RepoDO needs a tiny scheduler table (`next_job, due_at`) and one dispatching `alarm()`; hand-waved here.
- The LRU trim runs `SELECT ... ORDER BY last_hit` over the whole table on each sweep; at 32 MB / ~10 KB entries that is a few thousand rows, fine, but the budget should not be raised to gigabytes without a running-total column.
- Single-DO throughput: every cached read still serialises through one DO; this helps latency and R2 class-B op costs (one `GET` per miss instead of per read) but does not add read parallelism. Edge read replicas are `replicated-refs-edge` / Cache API, not this.
- R2 `get` on miss counts against the 30 s wall clock of the enclosing request only once; the 128 MB memory limit, not CPU time, is the constraint here. Deltified objects (`ofs-delta` / `ref-delta`) are not cached in delta form; the miss path assumes R2 stores fully resolved loose objects, which `streaming-pack-parser` must guarantee.

## Depends on
- repo-do-ref-authority
- refs-sqlite-objects-r2
- content-addressed-r2-keys
- streaming-pack-parser (must write resolved, zlib'd loose objects with `kind`/`size` custom metadata)
