# Rate-limited, token-scoped remote URLs

## Mechanism
The remote URL is `https://git.example/t/<payload>.<hmac>/owner/repo.git`, where `<payload>` is base64url JSON `{id, repo, ref, exp, maxPushes, maxBytes}` and `<hmac>` is HMAC-SHA256 over it with a Worker secret, so the edge Worker verifies scope and expiry with WebCrypto and zero storage lookups. Every git request under that prefix (`info/refs?service=git-receive-pack`, then `POST git-receive-pack`) hits the Worker, which parses the pkt-line command section of the push body *before* touching the PACK and rejects any `<old> <new> <refname>` line whose refname is not the scoped one. If the commands pass, the Worker calls the repo DO (`idFromName(owner/repo)`) over RPC to atomically debit a `token_usage` row in DO SQLite (push count, bytes, revoked flag); only then is the pack streamed to the ingester, and the DO re-checks the same scope inside its ref CAS. A DO alarm set to the earliest `exp` deletes expired usage rows.

## Primitives
- Workers (fetch handler, WebCrypto `crypto.subtle` HMAC-SHA256, Worker secrets via `wrangler secret put`) — GA
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm` / `alarm()`) — GA
- DO RPC methods on a `DurableObject` subclass (`stub.reserve(...)`) — GA
- Streaming `Request.body` (ReadableStream) forwarded untouched to the pack ingester — GA
- R2 is not touched by this idea directly; the pack ingester it hands off to writes there

## Why it works
- `git push` to an HTTPS remote does exactly two requests, `GET .../info/refs?service=git-receive-pack` then `POST .../git-receive-pack`; both carry the token because git keeps the full URL from `.git/config` and appends the suffix. Nothing on the client needs to change and no credential helper is involved.
- The receive-pack body is a fixed shape: pkt-lines `<old-sha> <new-sha> <refname>\0capabilities` terminated by a flush-pkt `0000`, then the `PACK` stream. The Worker can therefore evaluate scope after a few hundred bytes and refuse before inflating a single object, so an out-of-scope push costs no R2 writes and no DO CPU.
- Rejection is delivered in the language git already understands: `report-status` (`unpack ok`, `ng <ref> <reason>`, flush). The client prints `! [remote rejected] main -> main (token scoped to refs/heads/feature)` and exits non-zero instead of hanging. Because token URLs never advertise `side-band-64k`, the status does not need band-1 framing.
- Advertising only the scoped ref in `info/refs` is legal: git computes `<old-sha>` from the advertisement, so an unscoped branch simply looks nonexistent and a push to it is caught by the command check anyway. `ok`/`ng` per-ref lines let the DO reject sibling refs while still failing the whole push atomically, which matches `receive-pack`'s default (non-`atomic`) semantics.
- The rate limit is exact, not eventually consistent: one DO per repo (repo-do-ref-authority) plus synchronous `sql.exec` means the read-check-increment in `reserve` cannot interleave with another push using the same token.
- Expiry is enforced twice with no clock skew problem: at the edge from the signed `exp`, and by the alarm that deletes usage rows after `exp`, so a token that is re-presented after expiry both fails the HMAC-time check and finds no budget row.

## Known limits
- The token lives in the URL, so it ends up in `.git/config`, shell history, proxy logs and Worker request logs. Mitigation is short expiry (one hour as stated) and `revoke()`; it cannot be made secret-safe the way an `Authorization` header can.
- `Content-Length` is absent when git switches to chunked transfer for pushes above `http.postBuffer` (1 MiB default), so the byte budget for large pushes must be enforced by the pack ingester counting bytes as it streams, and the reservation above only sees `0`. A malicious client can therefore stream up to `maxBytes` before being cut off; it cannot exceed it.
- A push that starts before `exp` and finishes after it is accepted; the DO CAS could re-check `exp` but then legitimate slow pushes over slow links would be lost at the last step. The proof accepts the request-start check.
- Workers CPU limit (30 s default, more with `limits.cpu_ms`) applies to the Worker doing the command parse and the handoff, which is trivial; the pack ingest cost belongs to streaming-pack-parser. DO memory (128 MB) is irrelevant here because `token_usage` rows are a few dozen bytes.
- Single-DO throughput: every push to the repo, tokened or not, serializes through the repo DO, so a burst of thousands of tokened pushes per second is bounded by the DO, not by the limiter. That is the intended design (repo-do-ref-authority), not a limiter artifact.
- Token minting (`POST /owner/repo/tokens` behind normal auth) and the `revoke` endpoint are hand-waved; they are a straight application of auth-and-multitenancy. Secret rotation invalidates every outstanding token unless a `kid` is added to the payload and two keys are accepted during rollover.
- Push is protocol v0 `receive-pack` even when `protocol.version=2` is set (v2 has no push command as of git 2.4x), so this proof does not need protocol-v2-only, but it does need the pkt-line codec from info-refs-endpoint.
