# Diff API served with R2 range reads

## Mechanism
`GET /:owner/:repo/diff?from=<blob-oid>&to=<blob-oid>` (or a commit pair that the DO first narrows to changed blob pairs by tree walk) is routed by the Worker to the repo DO (`idFromName(owner/repo)`), which owns a SQLite table `pack_objects(oid, pack, offset, clen, type, base_oid)` filled by the streaming pack parser at push time and rewritten by the repack alarm. If `to` is stored in a pack as an OFS/REF-delta whose base is `from` (or the reverse), the DO issues exactly one `env.BUCKET.get(pack, { range })` for the delta entry, inflates it, and decodes git's copy/insert opcode stream into an edit script; `to` is never reconstructed. The edit script alone answers "what changed, how many bytes inserted, which base ranges dropped"; rendering a unified diff with line context additionally needs the base blob, which is one more range read (or zero if it sits in the in-DO cache). If the packer chose a different base, the DO falls back to two range reads plus an in-Worker Myers diff and says so in the response.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`) — GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) for the path-aware repack that makes "delta base == previous version" true by construction — GA
- R2 range reads (`get(key, { range: { offset, length } })`) — GA
- `node:zlib` `inflateSync(..., { info: true })` under `nodejs_compat` (tolerates the over-estimated range; `DecompressionStream("deflate")` works too but rejects trailing bytes, so it needs the exact compressed length) — GA
- Workers `Response` JSON/stream — GA

## Proof code
```typescript

  },
};

export class RepoDO implements DurableObject {
  constructor(private ctx: DurableObjectState, private env: Env) {
    // Filled by the streaming pack parser on push (clen = next entry offset - offset, an upper bound)
    // and rewritten by the repack alarm, which deltifies each blob against its same-path predecessor.
    ctx.storage.sql.exec(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pack_objects (
      oid TEXT PRIMARY KEY, pack TEXT NOT NULL, offset INTEGER NOT NULL, clen INTEGER NOT NULL,
      type INTEGER NOT NULL, base_oid TEXT)`);

    const T = e(to), F = e(from);

## Why it works
- A packfile entry is self-delimiting: `[type|size varint][ofs/ref base][zlib stream]`. With `offset` and an upper-bound `clen` from the pack index kept in DO SQLite, one R2 range read returns exactly one object's delta without touching the rest of the pack; the `.idx` file is never consulted at request time.
- git's delta stream is a copy/insert edit script against a single base object. Decoding it yields the changed byte ranges directly, so "is it changed", inserted/deleted byte counts and the raw inserted text come from the delta alone with no base and no target reconstruction.
- The packer chooses delta bases by name-hash and size, so same-path successive versions are usually each other's base already; the repack alarm makes this deterministic by deltifying every blob against its same-path predecessor in the commit graph. Because we own the packer, "pack delta == history diff" is a policy, not luck.
- Deltas are one-directional but symmetric in information: if the older blob is stored as a delta of the newer one (git's usual direction, since larger objects are packed first), the same ops describe the reverse diff — literal inserts are deletions, uncovered base ranges are additions.
- The response is a normal `Response.json`, so the Worker adds nothing; the DO does at most one R2 request per hunk-less answer and one chain walk per fallback, all well inside the 30s CPU budget.

## Known limits
- The idea as literally stated ("no reconstruction at all") only holds for byte-level answers. A unified diff with line context must inflate the base blob (one range read, more if the base is itself a delta) because you cannot range-read into the middle of a zlib stream; the target side is still never rebuilt.
- When the packer's base is not the history predecessor (fresh push packs use git's own heuristics; renames; cross-path bases), the fast path misses and the DO does a full two-sided reconstruction plus Myers in the isolate. Hit rate depends on the repack alarm having run.
- Loose objects written by the streaming parser before the first repack are whole blobs, not deltas: no fast path until `gc-and-repack-alarm` fires.
- Every blob pair is one DO round trip, so a commit-level diff over N changed files costs N+ R2 GETs (~$0.36 per million Class B ops) and is serialized through the single repo DO.
- Blobs above a few tens of MB blow the 128 MB DO memory on the fallback path; the fast path still works since only the delta is loaded. Chain depth 50 x large bases is the worst case.
- `inflateSync` on an over-estimated range is used to dodge `DecompressionStream` rejecting trailing bytes; storing the exact compressed length (the parser knows it) removes that dependency.
- Tree walk from commit pair to blob pairs is hand-waved; it is the same tree-diff every git server does.
