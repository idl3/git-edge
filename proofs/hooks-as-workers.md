# Pre/post-receive hooks as Workers via service bindings

## Mechanism
The repo DO keeps a `hooks` table (phase, target) that the owner fills through `PUT /:owner/:repo/hooks`; a target is either a static service binding name (`service:HOOK_LINT`, wired in git-edge's own wrangler.jsonc, for first-party or self-hosted deployments) or, for arbitrary user-deployed Workers, a script name in a Workers for Platforms dispatch namespace (`dispatch:acme-policy`, resolved with `env.HOOKS.get(name)`). During `git-receive-pack`, after the Worker has streamed the pack into R2 and before the DO's ref compare-and-swap transaction, `RepoDO.commit()` resolves each `pre-receive` target to a `Fetcher` and POSTs the exact stdin git would hand a pre-receive hook (`<old-sha> <new-sha> <refname>\n` per line, plus JSON and a scoped read token so the hook can `git fetch` the pending objects) with a 10 s `AbortSignal.timeout`; any non-2xx turns into `ng <ref> <body>` for every ref, mirroring git's all-or-nothing pre-receive. `post-receive` rows are inserted into an `outbox` table inside the same SQLite transaction that flips the refs, and a DO alarm drains the outbox with backoff, so post-receive delivery is at-least-once and survives the DO being evicted.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) — GA
- DO alarms (`setAlarm` / `alarm()`) for the post-receive outbox — GA
- Service bindings (`Fetcher` in `env`, `fetch()` or RPC via `WorkerEntrypoint`) — GA; static per wrangler config, one binding per registered hook Worker
- Workers for Platforms dispatch namespaces (`env.HOOKS.get(scriptName)`) for user-registered Workers — GA, but a paid add-on; without it "register your own Worker" degrades to an HTTPS webhook URL with an HMAC header
- Dynamic Workers / Worker Loaders (`env.LOADER.get(id, () => ({ mainModule, modules }))`) as an alternative for hook *source* uploaded to the host — **beta**, not used in the proof
- R2 (`pending/<pushId>/` objects already written by the two-phase push; the hook reads them through the normal smart-HTTP endpoint, not R2 directly) — GA
- `AbortSignal.timeout`, `crypto.subtle` HMAC for webhook fallback — GA

## Why it works
- git's pre-receive contract is "stdin gets `<old> <new> <ref>` lines, exit 0 allows, non-zero rejects every ref in the push, stderr goes to the client as `remote:` lines". The proof sends byte-identical stdin, maps HTTP status to the exit code and the response body to the reason; `git push` prints `! [remote rejected] main -> main (pre-receive hook declined: ...)` because `commit()` returns `ng <ref> <reason>` for each command and the Worker emits it as report-status pkt-lines (`ok`/`ng` after `unpack ok`, sideband channel 2 for the free-text message).
- Ordering matches `git-receive-pack`: objects are unpacked (already in R2 under `pending/<pushId>/` from the two-phase push) *before* pre-receive runs, so the hook can inspect the new commits; refs move only after the hook accepts; post-receive sees only refs that actually changed.
- Pre-receive must not run inside `transactionSync` (it awaits), and it does not need to: the DO re-checks `old == current` in the transaction afterwards, so a concurrent push that slipped in between yields `fetch first`, exactly the race git resolves with its ref lock.
- A service-binding call is an in-process subrequest, not a public HTTP hop: the DO's `Fetcher.fetch()` or RPC lands directly in the hook Worker with no DNS, TLS or origin round trip, which is what keeps a synchronous pre-receive gate inside a 10 s budget. Dispatch-namespace stubs (`env.HOOKS.get(name)`) have the same `Fetcher` shape, so one code path serves both.
- Post-receive in git is fire-and-forget and lossy; enqueueing the outbox row in the same SQLite transaction as the ref flip makes it strictly better (atomic with the update, retried by the alarm, single-threaded per repo so ordering per repo is preserved).
- The `x-git-edge-depth` header plus a scoped token lets a hook fetch the pending objects through the ordinary `git-upload-pack` endpoint (with the token unlocking `pending/<pushId>/`) rather than exposing R2, and stops a hook that pushes back to the same repo from recursing.

## Known limits
- **"Register a Worker" literally via service bindings is not possible at runtime.** Service bindings are declared in wrangler.jsonc at deploy time, so `service:` targets only cover hooks the git-edge operator ships (or a self-hosted single-tenant deployment). Letting *users* register their own Worker requires Workers for Platforms (dispatch namespaces, paid add-on) or falls back to an HTTPS webhook with HMAC-signed body, which loses the in-process latency advantage.
- The push client waits on pre-receive synchronously; the DO has no wall-clock limit but the hook Worker has a 30 s CPU cap (up to 5 min on paid) and the proof caps it at 10 s. Long policy checks belong in post-receive or in alarm-chain-ci.
- Only `pre-receive` and `post-receive` are modelled; git's `update` (per-ref, partial reject) and `post-update` are trivial variants but omitted; `proc-receive` / `push-options` (`-o key=val`) are hand-waved (they would ride in the JSON header).
- Hooks cannot run git commands. `isFastForward` in the sample must be implemented by walking commits via git-edge's own HTTP API or by the hook doing a smart-HTTP `fetch` of the pending objects, which costs R2 reads (class B ops) and, for deep history, multiple Worker subrequests; the proof hand-waves this function.
- DO subrequest cap (1000 per incoming request) and 128 MB memory: hook fan-out is per-registered-hook, sequential, and payloads are ref lines only, so this is far from the cap; but a pre-receive hook that itself fetches a giant pack runs in its own Worker under its own limits.
- Single-DO throughput: pre-receive latency adds directly to the repo's push serialisation window (the DO can interleave other requests during the `await`, but CAS conflicts rise). Post-receive is off the critical path.
- Outbox rows carry no authentication secret rotation; HMAC signing and secret storage for the webhook fallback are not shown.

## Depends on
- two-phase-push (objects in R2 under `pending/<pushId>/` before refs flip; `commit()` is its phase two)
- repo-do-ref-authority (the single DO that serialises CAS and hosts the hooks/outbox tables)
- auth-and-multitenancy (owner/repo → DO id, and the scoped `pushId` token the hook uses to read pending objects)
- scoped-token-remotes (optional: the read token the hook receives)
- github-webhook-compat (optional: alternative JSON payload shape for post-receive)
