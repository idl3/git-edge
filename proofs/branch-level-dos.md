# Branch-level Durable Objects for monorepos

## Mechanism
The Worker keeps one `RepoRoot` DO per repo (`idFromName("owner/repo")`) that owns only HEAD, the shard registry and ACLs, and N `RefShard` DOs (`idFromName("owner/repo#refs/heads/team-a")`) that each own the refs under one namespace prefix in their own SQLite `refs` table. On `git-receive-pack` the Worker reads the pkt-line command section (`<old> <new> <refname>\0caps`), indexes the packfile straight into content-addressed R2 (`objects/<sha>`) exactly as the unsharded design does, then groups the commands by namespace and calls each shard's `updateRefs()` in parallel; each shard runs its compare-and-swap in one SQLite transaction and returns per-ref `ok`/`ng` lines the Worker concatenates into the report-status. On protocol v2 `ls-refs`, the `ref-prefix` argument routes the request to exactly the shard(s) that own that prefix, so a fetch of `refs/heads/main` never touches the DO that is absorbing a firehose of pushes to `refs/heads/ci/*`; a prefix-less `ls-refs` or v0 receive-pack advertisement fans out to every shard in the registry with `Promise.all` and merges the sorted lists.

## Primitives
- Durable Objects with SQLite storage (`ctx.storage.sql.exec`, `transactionSync`) - GA
- DO RPC methods (`extends DurableObject`, `stub.updateRefs(...)`) - GA
- DO `idFromName` deterministic sharding by `owner/repo#namespace` - GA
- DO alarms (`ctx.storage.setAlarm`) for shard registry heartbeat/reaping empty shards - GA
- R2 `put`/`head` for content-addressed objects; `get` with `range` for pack slices - GA
- Workers `Response` streaming + `DecompressionStream("deflate")` for zlib entries in the PACK - GA
- Location hints (`newUniqueId({jurisdiction})` / `locationHint`) for placing shards near their writers - GA

## Why it works
- Git's consistency unit is the ref, not the repo: `git-receive-pack` reports `ok <ref>` / `ng <ref> <reason>` per command in report-status, so independent shards each answering for their own refs is exactly the wire contract a non-`--atomic` push already accepts.
- Objects are shared, refs are partitioned: because every object lives at `objects/<sha>` in R2 before any ref moves (two-phase push), a shard's connectivity check is an R2 `head` on the tip plus its own graph, and never needs another shard's SQLite. A feature-branch push that assumes `main`'s objects exist finds them in R2 regardless of which DO advanced `main`.
- Protocol v2 `ls-refs` carries `ref-prefix`, and modern clients send it for `git fetch origin main` and for every `git pull`; the Worker turns the prefix into a shard id with `idFromName`, so the hot path for readers of a quiet branch is one DO hop and never queues behind the busy shard's single-threaded input gate.
- CAS on `old` sha inside `transactionSync` in each shard preserves the "fetch first" / non-fast-forward semantics git expects; a stale old-sha rolls back only that shard's batch, matching git's per-ref failure model.
- The registry DO is off the write path except for an idempotent `register` after the ref update, so it cannot become the serialization point the idea is trying to remove; a periodic alarm can reap namespaces whose shard has zero refs.

## Known limits
- `git push --atomic` spanning two namespaces cannot be honored by this alone: each shard commits independently. The Worker must either reject with `ng ... atomic-across-shards` when the client advertised `atomic`, or run the two-phase commit from cross-repo-atomic-push across shards (prepare/lock in each shard, then commit) - that reintroduces coordination, but only for the rare cross-namespace push.
- receive-pack has no v2: its ref advertisement must list every ref, so every push still fans out to all shards for the advertisement (reads only, parallel). With hundreds of namespaces that is hundreds of DO round trips per push; a KV/replicated advertisement (replicated-refs-edge) or a root-DO cached snapshot refreshed by alarm is the practical fix, at the cost of a slightly stale advertisement (harmless: CAS in the shard still rejects stale old-shas).
- Prefix-less `ls-refs` (bare `git ls-remote`, first clone) also fans out; the shard registry must be complete or refs silently vanish from the listing. `register` after `updateRefs` leaves a crash window where a shard has refs but is unregistered; fix by registering before the update (idempotent, cheap).
- Namespace granularity is static (`shardOf`). One hot branch such as `refs/heads/main` still lands on one DO and the single-DO throughput ceiling (roughly hundreds of small CAS writes/sec, one request at a time through the input gate) is unchanged for that branch; sharding helps siblings, not the hot ref itself.
- Connectivity is approximated by an R2 `head` on the tip plus whatever the pack contained; a full reachability walk across a branch that was created in another shard needs a commit-graph table (want-have-negotiation) or bounded R2 walks. Each R2 `head`/`get` is a billed Class B op.
- The Worker still has to index the whole pack within the request: DO 128 MB memory is not involved (the pack never enters a DO), but the Worker's CPU limit (30 s default, configurable up to 5 min on paid) and the streaming inflater bound the maximum single-push size.
- HEAD symref, ACLs and push-options live in the root DO, so a fetch that asks for `symrefs` costs one extra hop.
