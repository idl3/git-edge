## Mechanism
This idea is only partially subsumed. The authority half — one `RepoDo` per repo, per-ref compare-and-swap, the `refs_version` bump — is contract section 3 (`commit_push`, proved in `repo-do-ref-authority`), and the v2 `info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` advertisement is already static at the edge with no DO call (rule 6, `info-refs-endpoint`). What remains genuinely new is a post-foundation module in two halves. `repo_do/refs_publish.rs` is a `JobKind::RefPublish` slice — the only writer of KV — that serialises `refs` (`name`, `target`, `peeled` from A5) plus `meta.head` plus `meta.refs_version` into one KV value `refs/<owner>/<repo>` on binding `REFS_KV`, whenever `refs_version` passes a new `meta` cursor `refs_published`, debounced to KV's ~1 write/s/key by a 1 s `run_at`. `edge/refs_kv.rs` serves `command=ls-refs` (and the v0 upload-pack `info/refs`) from that snapshot through the same `wire::write_ls_refs` / `wire::write_advertisement_v0` the DO path uses, with the client's `x-git-edge-version` header as a read-your-writes floor; a miss, a stale snapshot, a corrupt one, or a KV error all fall through to `/_do/ls-refs` (one sync span, 1.3). The `fetch` command, `git-receive-pack`, and the receive-pack `info/refs` keep going to the DO. Everything added is in the REGISTRY block (A9); the four small contract deltas are listed there and in Known limits. Two weakenings are stated, not hidden: KV is a pull-through edge cache, not a replica (a cold or expired colo still pays a central read), and `locationHint` is creation-time and best-effort — the replicas here are KV values, not DOs.

## Primitives
- `Env::kv("REFS_KV")` -> `KvStore::{get, put}`; `get(..).cache_ttl(60).json::<T>() -> Result<Option<T>, KvError>`; `put(..)? -> PutOptionsBuilder::execute()`: verified in `worker` 0.8.5 source (docs.rs). **Not exercised by the spike**, which touched R2 only; KV from a DO alarm context and local-workerd KV TTL/propagation semantics are **unverified**.
- KV platform limits (GA, quoted correctly by the first pass and its review): ~1 write/s/key (hence `DEBOUNCE_MS`), 25 MiB value cap, `cacheTtl` minimum 60 s, eventual consistency typically under 60 s. Source: Cloudflare KV docs.
- `ObjectNamespace::get_by_name_with_location_hint(name, hint) -> Result<Stub>`: verified in `worker` 0.8.5 source (docs.rs), **not run**. `locationHint` applies at first creation only and is best-effort (Cloudflare DO docs; first-pass review).
- `jobs::{enqueue, dispatch}` with a new `JobKind::RefPublish` arm and `SliceOutcome::{Done, Reschedule}`: contract section 4, A3/A4. `enqueue` is sync and dedups against `queued` **or** `running` rows of the same kind (4.5) — a property this design depends on, see Why it works. Only `jobs::rearm` calls `set_alarm`; a second `setAlarm` cancels the first, measured (#5).
- Sync-span atomicity for the two spans around the KV put: measured (platform-facts #4). The put await opens the input gate; that is handled by the post-await recheck, not assumed away.
- `SELECT changes()` / `CAST(value AS INTEGER)` over TEXT `meta` values: `changes()` measured 1/0/1 (#1); `refs_published` is stored as TEXT like every `meta` value.
- `wire::write_ls_refs` / `write_advertisement_v0` covering `symrefs`, `peel`, `unborn`, `ref-prefix`, `HEAD`-first: measured in the spike against git 2.43 (`protocol-v2-only`). `refs.peeled` exists per A5.
- `Stub::fetch_with_request` + `internal_request` for the fallthrough: stub call verified (spike); the `RequestInit` constructor path is **unverified at runtime**, as in every sibling proof.
- `serde_json::{to_vec, from_slice}` over our own snapshot bytes: verified. `js_sys::Date::now()`: standard `js-sys`.

## Proof code
```rust
// src/repo_do/refs_publish.rs + src/edge/refs_kv.rs + glue lines in edge/{upload,info-refs,receive}.rs

```

## Why it works
- **The KV answer is byte-identical to the DO answer.** The snapshot stores `head` (`meta.head`, symbolic, section 3) and per-ref `peeled` (A5), and the edge renders it with the same `write_ls_refs`/`write_advertisement_v0` the DO path uses — so `symref-target:`, `peeled:`, `unborn HEAD`, `ref-prefix` filtering and byte-length pkt-lines are identical by construction (rules 1, 5-7; spike-measured). `git clone` checks out because the writer emits `HEAD`, not because KV special-cases it.
- **One writer, one atomic value, one monotonic version.** `refs_version` is bumped inside the commit span (3 step 5); span 1 captures the rows and the version together, so the published JSON is exactly version `v`. A reader in Tokyo and one in Frankfurt can see v6 and v7, never a torn list — KV stores the snapshot atomically.
- **Lost publish cannot recur (the review's two holes).** The enqueue rides inside the commit's sync span — no dangling `getAlarm().then(setAlarm)` — and A3's post-span `rearm` arms the alarm before the response. If the DO dies between span and rearm, the `queued` row survives but fires nothing; `publish_boot_check` closes that on the next request of any kind, since `refs_version > refs_published` re-enqueues (deduped) and the caller's `rearm` arms it — a quiet repo is healed by its next read, not its next push. A commit during the KV await bumps `refs_version` while its own `enqueue` dedups against the *running* row (4.5); the slice's post-await recheck is the only place that can see that, and `Reschedule` publishes the newer version one debounce later. Worst staleness is bounded by KV propagation (~60 s) + `cacheTtl` (60 s), never "until someone pushes again".
- **Stale can only mean old, never wrong.** Refs name immutable objects; an older snapshot yields an older-but-consistent advertisement. `fetch` always goes to the DO, which validates every `want` against live refs through `Index::lookup` (9.1), so KV lag can never mint a want for an unknown object or a bad pack. A force-pushed-away tip stays fetchable because its pack is only deletable `dead_at + GRACE` (section 5): GRACE 1 h against ~2 min worst KV staleness is a 30x margin — the review's "GC grace must exceed KV lag" is now a contract constant, not a sibling's TODO.
- **Read-your-writes is a floor, not a flag.** `x-git-edge-version` on the report-status response (via `CommitResponse.refs_version`) is echoed by configured clients; `min_version` refuses any snapshot older than what this client already saw and falls through to `/_do/ls-refs`. Unconfigured stock git gets plain eventual consistency — stated in Known limits, matching the review's verdict that this is inherent.
- **Failure policy.** KV errors, misses, stale, oversized (`body > KV_MAX_BYTES` advances the cursor without a put) and corrupt snapshots all degrade to the DO path; KV can never turn `git fetch` into a 500. The publish job's own errors retry through section 4.4 backoff and a `dead` row never blocks the queue (4.5); A4's boot rule re-enqueues it anyway.
- **Budget arithmetic (7.1).** ls-refs costs 1 KV subrequest instead of 1 stub call — the count is the same but the KV read is colo-local within the TTL; publish costs 1 put + sync SQL per ref-change burst, debounced; receive-pack is unchanged plus one sync `enqueue`. The receive-pack `info/refs` stays on the DO deliberately: its advertised oids feed the CAS (3 step 4) and staleness there produces spurious `ng`, while the v2 upload-pack advertisement needed no work at all (static, rule 6).

## Changes from the first pass
| First-pass finding (quoted) | Kind | How addressed |
|---|---|---|
| "Lost-publish race in `alarm()` (dirty cleared after concurrent push) and no alarm re-arm after crash: KV can stay stale indefinitely, which turns 'up to 2 minutes old' into 'until someone pushes again'" — and "void getAlarm().then(setAlarm) is a dangling promise racing the response" | blocker | The `dirty` flag is replaced by a version cursor `refs_published`. Enqueue happens inside the commit span (no dangling promise); A3 `rearm` arms it post-span. Crash between span and rearm: the `queued` row persists and `publish_boot_check` re-arms on the next request whenever `refs_version > refs_published`. Commit during the KV await: post-await recheck -> `Reschedule`, because the interleaved `enqueue` deduped against the running row (4.5). |
| "CAS rejection throws out of `updateRefs` instead of returning `ng`; real `git push` sees a 500 on any non-fast-forward" — and "all-or-nothing rollback is only correct when the client sent `atomic`; git's default is per-ref" | blocker | Closed by the contract, not this module: `commit_push` (section 3) applies each ref as its own CAS with `SELECT changes()` and reports `ng <ref> failed to update ref` per ref in client order; nothing throws out of the span (A2), and `atomic` is not advertised (rule 5). |
| "`HEAD`/`symref-target` absent from the snapshot: `git clone` cannot check out" | blocker | `Snapshot.head` carries `meta.head` and `Snapshot.refs[].peeled` carries the A5 column; `write_ls_refs` emits `symref-target:` on `symrefs` and `unborn HEAD symref-target:` on an empty repo (protocol-v2-only, spike-tested against git 2.43). |
| "`pkt()` computes length from `s.length` (UTF-16 code units); a refname with non-ASCII bytes yields a wrong pkt-line length" | caveat | Closed structurally: `gix-packetline`'s `data_to_write` computes byte lengths over `&[u8]` and ref names are `BString` end to end (rule 1). |
| "`ref-prefix` is ignored ... `unborn` on an empty repo must produce `unborn HEAD symref-target:refs/heads/main`" | caveat | `write_ls_refs` implements both (protocol-v2-only). An empty repo never reaches KV — `refs_version` 0 equals `refs_published` 0, so nothing is published and every request falls through to the DO, which answers correctly. |
| "The v2 `info/refs` reply is static ... and must be served by the Worker for the latency claim to hold; the proof routes it to the DO" / "`info/refs` must be answered at the edge too or the DO hop remains on every fetch" | caveat | The v2 advertisement was already static at the edge (rule 6, `info-refs-endpoint`). The v0 upload-pack advertisement now tries the snapshot first (`info_refs` glue). The receive-pack advertisement deliberately stays on the DO — see Why it works. |
| "`x-git-edge-version` is never sent by stock git; needs `http.extraHeader` per remote" / "Read-your-writes requires client configuration" | caveat | Inherent; unchanged. The push response sets `x-git-edge-version` (write-back via `CommitResponse.refs_version`); configured clients echo it and `min_version` enforces the floor. Everyone else gets eventual consistency, which the review called the correct honest statement. |
| "KV is a pull-through cache, not a replica: cold or expired colos still make a central round trip; the win is repeat fetches within 60s per colo" | caveat | Inherent; stated in Mechanism and Known limits. `cache_ttl(60)` makes repeat reads colo-local; nothing here claims otherwise. |
| "GC grace period must exceed KV lag; owned by a sibling idea, not enforced here" | caveat | Now owned by the contract: `GRACE = 1 h` (section 5) exceeds worst KV staleness (~2 min) by 30x, and dead packs are only deletable after it. |
| "`locationHint` is creation-time only and best-effort; the title over-promises" | caveat | Kept, honest, and now code-backed: `RepoRoute::stub` honours `GE_DO_HINT` through `get_by_name_with_location_hint` (worker 0.8.5 source). It cannot move an existing DO — Known limits. |

## Known limits
- KV is a pull-through edge cache, not a replica: the first read in a colo, and any read after the 60 s TTL, still pays a central KV read. Nothing in this module changes that; the win is repeat `ls-refs`/`ls-remote`/`fetch` negotiation within the TTL, which is the common case the idea targeted.
- Read-your-writes needs `http.extraHeader: x-git-edge-version` per remote (CI runners can set it; stock git cannot send custom headers without config). Unconfigured clients can observe up to ~120 s of staleness (60 s propagation + 60 s TTL), including an apparent rollback after their own push.
- 25 MiB value cap is ~250k refs at ~100 B/ref of JSON. Past it, `refs_published` advances without a put and the repo silently runs on the DO path — operator-visible only via the absence of `x-git-edge-source: kv`. Sharding is `branch-level-dos`'s problem.
- `locationHint` influences first creation only and is best-effort; it cannot move a DO whose pushers migrate continents. `get_by_name_with_location_hint` is verified in `worker` 0.8.5 source but unverified at runtime; `GE_DO_HINT` is one env-wide value, not per-repo.
- The KV key is `refs/<owner>/<repo>`, name-derived because the edge must compute it before any DO contact; a rename (out of scope, section 12) would strand the old key. R2 keys use `repo_id` (8.4) precisely because they outlive names.
- Write-backs proposed to CONTRACTS.md, each small: `commit_push` step 7 also runs `jobs::enqueue(&sql, JobKind::RefPublish, now + DEBOUNCE_MS, "{}")` when `any_ok`; `CommitResponse` gains `refs_version` and `receive_pack` sets `x-git-edge-version` on the report-status response; `boot` calls `publish_boot_check` after the A4 Janitor check; `meta` gains `refs_published` (init `'0'`); `RepoRoute::stub` honours `GE_DO_HINT`.
- KV on local workerd (`wrangler dev` local emulation) is assumed to work for the harness; its TTL/propagation is not simulated, so staleness is exercised through `refs_version` ordering, not wall-clock lag. No platform-facts row covers KV.
- Scenarios this proof must pass (section 11): 1, 2, 12, 13. Added (two): (a) "stale snapshot + read-your-writes": `git push` a branch, capture `x-git-edge-version` N from the response; before the alarm fires, plain `git ls-remote` shows the old tip while `git -c http.extraHeader="x-git-edge-version: N" ls-remote` shows the new one; fire the alarm; plain `ls-remote` shows N. (b) "burst coalesces and heals": two pushes inside one debounce window, fire the alarm once, assert `refs_published == refs_version` and exactly one KV value change; then push once more, make any DO-bound request (`git fetch`) so `boot` runs `publish_boot_check`, fire the alarm, assert the new version is served from KV (`x-git-edge-source: kv`).
